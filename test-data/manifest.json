Nanostructured scaffolds have been discovered to be more efficient for bone regeneration than macro/micro-sized scaffolds because they sufficiently permit cell adhesion, proliferation, and chemical transformation. Nanofibrous scaffolds mimicking artificial extracellular matrices provide a natural environment for tissue regeneration owin..."

However, the quantitative assessment tools have not been emphasized. The quantitative assessment tools can be more accurate and robust in cases of challenging multidisciplinary fields like that of Biomedical Engineering which includes biomedicine elements mixed with technology aspects.

The clinical efficacy of such gene therapies has already been..."
