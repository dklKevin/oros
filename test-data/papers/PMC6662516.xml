Being a biocompatible nanomaterial with outstanding physical, chemical, optical, and biological properties, graphene-based materials were successfully employed in creating the perfect scaffold for a range of organs, starting from the skin through to the brain. Investigations on 2D and 3D tissue culture scaffolds incorporated with graphene or its derivatives have revealed the capability of this carbon material in mimicking in vivo environment. The porous morphology, great surface area, selective permeability of gases, excellent mechanical strength, good thermal and electrical conductivity, good optical properties, and biodegradability enable graphene materials to be the best component for scaffold engineering. Along with the apt microenvironment, this material was found to be efficient in differentiating stem cells into specific cell types. Furthermore, the scope of graphene nanomaterials in liver tissue engineering as a promising biomaterial is also discussed.

This practice comprises the utilization of various aspects of cell biology, materials chemistry, biomaterials engineering, immunology, preclinical, clinical investigations, etc. The huge growing demand for organ and tissue transplants stimulated continuous investigations on the rejuvenating properties of cells. This encouraged the development of a revolutionary technique called tissue engineering, as an ultimate solution toward the tissue and organ damage. The critical factors to be considered in the regeneration of cells involve; the nature and origin of cells, scaffold materials used, scaffold design, cellular and outer environment for tissue formation, etc.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Introduction of stem cells to tissue engineering for tissue/organ repair revealed a novel perception of regenerative therapy. The undifferentiated pluripotent cells were utilized for the growth, proliferation, and differentiation to specific tissue/organ leading to successful trials in preclinical and clinical investigations. During the early stages, tissue engineering was used in the preparation of tissue construct outside the body and was then incorporated into the living being. However, in the current scenario, clinical tissue engineering involves the successful implantation and evaluation of the prepared tissue/organ via clinical studies. Numerous tissue engineering-based therapies such as wound healing and orthopedic applications have obtained approval from Food and Drug Administration for clinical experiments and are commercially available.

From the mechanical aspect, scaffolds assist to withstand external pressures and give structural support to the tissue to be regenerated. Considering the biological aspect, scaffolds are structures which support the development of extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell establishment. Moreover, the permeability of scaffold is another factor, where scaffolds should allow the transfer of nutrients from culture media and support the removal of toxic metabolites/by-products from the tissues without hindering the culturing conditions. Timely degradation of the scaffold material by allowing the takeover of the cells is another critical feature to be considered to support the regenerative tissue. Limited cell&#8211;cell interaction, lack of cellular organization, and difference from the real in vivo scenario are the main limiting factors of two-dimensional (2D) cell culture which could be improved by the use of more advanced 3D cell culture.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p></sec><sec id="S0001-S2003"><title>2D and 3D scaffolds</title><p>Generally, the types of cell culture are explained in terms of the dimension of cell growth as a 2D or 3D cell cultures. <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the pictorial representation of a 2D and 3D cell culture. 2D indicates the growth of cells as a monolayer in culture flasks, which normally involves a single type of cells growing on a planar surface. 2D cultures are extensively used in cell research due to factors such as easier cellular observation, direct measurement feasibility, inexpensive nature, prime scope in drug testing, and cytocompatibility. However, 2D cultures are not a perfect representation of the normal cellular environment in an organism. As a result, the 2D cultures exhibit abnormal structural features, mechanical constraints and often caused misleading results when tested in vivo. Ultimately, when considering pro-apoptotic factors in drug discovery and biocompatibility analysis, a remarkable difference in the results was observed in 2D and 3D cell cultures. Major changes were observed in terms of cell polarity, cell morphology, intracellular-extracellular protein production, receptor organization, gene expressions, etc.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Moreover, 2D scaffold-based tissue engineering faces concerns regarding mass transfer, whereby the availability of nutrients and oxygen is limited to the cells. This is due to the high surface to mass ratio of scaffolds which constraints the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of the tissue construct. Another concern is the development of multilayer tissue structures for the formation of complete organ (liver, kidney, heart, etc.), which has high ratios of surface area to mass and has a variety of similar cells present in the same scaffold which are needed in a specific cellular environment.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Having the advantage of mimicking the functions of a live tissue, 3D tissue culture bridges the gap between in vitro cell culture and real tissue.<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

Synthetic polymers such as polylactic acid (PLA), poly(glycolic acid), polyhydroxyalkanoate , and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) were also utilized in the preparation of 3D scaffold due to their easily adapting porosity, degradation time, and mechanical characteristics.<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In a 3D cell culture, the scaffold provides support for cells to maintain the biophysical and biomechanical interaction by acting as the ECM.

GO/CS/GN scaffold showed better physiochemical properties when tested for properties such as biodegradation, wettability, protein adsorption, and biomineralization, which all favored application toward bone tissue engineering. Additionally, it exhibited the potential to differentiate mouse mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts. The swelling property of the scaffold significantly improved with the addition of GO, probably due to the hydrophilic functionalities present in GO. Fibronectin and vinculin are essential proteins created by osteoblasts for assisting the attachment between cells and the scaffolds. The initial protein adsorption on biomaterials is a crucial factor for the successful biomaterial implants, where the addition of GO enhanced protein adsorption property of the 3D scaffold by providing its hydrophilic side functional groups and improving the surface area of the scaffold. The in vitro cytotoxicity and cell viability of the scaffold resulted in the expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes such as ALP, type-1-collagen, and osteocalcin. The in vivo osteogenic ability is assessed by the healing process of tibial bone defects in rat models, where it got filled with 0.25% GO/CS/GN scaffold.

Considering the success of graphene-based 3D scaffolds in heart, skin, bone, neuron, and cartilage engineering, it could also be a promising tool in cultivating hepatocytes for liver tissue engineering in the near future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors acknowledge financial support received from the United Arab Emirates University&#160;Start-up Research Fund, project number 31N154, UAE.</p></ack><sec id="S0005" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Lavik</surname><given-names>E</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Langer</surname><given-names>R</given-names></string-name>. <article-title>Tissue engineering: current state and perspectives</article-title>. <source><italic toggle="yes">Appl Microbiol Biotechnol</italic></source>. <year>2004</year>;<volume>65</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>1</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>8</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s00253-004-1580-z</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15221227</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Atala</surname><given-names>A</given-names></string-name>. <article-title>Engineering tissues, organs and cells</article-title>. <source><italic toggle="yes">J Tissue Eng Regen Med</italic></source>. <year>2007</year>;<volume>1</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>83</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>96</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/term.18</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18038397</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Lanza</surname><given-names>R</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Langer</surname><given-names>R</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Vacanti</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></string-name>. <source><italic toggle="yes">Principles of Tissue Engineering</italic></source>.
