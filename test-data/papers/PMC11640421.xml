Accordingly, transgene expression in OLs has either not been found or not been evaluated in most gene therapy studies in rodents or non-human primates. The aims of the current review are to give OLs their rightful place among the neural cells that future gene therapy could target and to encourage researchers to test the effect of OL transduction in various CNS diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AAV</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocytes</kwd><kwd>central nervous system</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Neuratris</funding-source><award-id>2022-X1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Therapy Design Consulting</funding-source><award-id>2024-003</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by Neuratris grant 2022-X1 and Therapy Design Consulting grant 2024-003.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cells-13-01973"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Gene therapy encompasses four basic approaches. Three of these apply to diseases caused by a single gene: (i) replacing a defective gene by a functional one; (ii) silencing a mutated gene whose gain of function is toxic to cells; and (iii) correcting an abnormal gene sequence in diseased cells. The fourth approach, gene addition, aims to transfer an opportunistic gene not physiologically expressed in target cells to counteract a pathogenic mechanism. Gene transfer currently holds out major hope for the future treatment of certain debilitating diseases of the CNS [<xref rid="B1-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This is the case for common diseases, such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) or Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD), as well as less frequent or rare diseases, sometimes involving only a single case [<xref rid="B12-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>While neurons and astrocytes are most often targeted, several reasons may explain why OLs have been left out of most attempts in CNS gene therapy. First, the role of OLs in many diseases is just beginning to emerge, as discussed in <xref rid="sec3-cells-13-01973" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>. Another explanation is that most gene therapy studies have used adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors equipped with CAG, CBA, CBh, and CMV promoters. Although considered ubiquitous, these promoters do not activate transgene expression within OLs for unknown biological reasons, unless high doses of a vector are administered [<xref rid="B13-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, in almost all gene therapy studies in rodents or non-human primates (NHPs) using such promoters, OL transduction was either absent [<xref rid="B14-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], not mentioned [<xref rid="B15-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or apparently discordant, as discussed in <xref rid="sec5dot1-cells-13-01973" ref-type="sec">Section 5.1</xref>. Based on these observations, OLs have sometimes been wrongly considered resistant to AAV gene therapy.</p><p>This review focuses on AAV vectors, which are at the forefront of advances in gene therapy in CNS diseases.

A Brief Overview of Oligodendrocyte Functions</title><p>The 17.4 million OLs represent 20% of the cells populating the adult mouse brain [<xref rid="B30-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the human brain, the total number of neocortical OLs is 21&#8211;29 billion [<xref rid="B31-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with nearly 5 billion in the corpus callosum [<xref rid="B32-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The number of OLs increases linearly from 7 to 28 billion during the first three years of life, totaling two-thirds of the adult OL population [<xref rid="B33-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although heterogeneous [<xref rid="B34-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and becoming regionally diverse with age [<xref rid="B38-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the OL population is remarkably stable in humans, with an annual exchange of only 1/300 OLs, constant from 5 years of age, a 100-fold lower renewal rate compared to mice [<xref rid="B32-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This extremely low OL turnover rate is favorable to AAV gene therapy because it allows transgene copies to persist durably in these rarely dividing cells. A major role of OLs is the synthesis of myelin and enwrapment of axons with myelin sheaths. OL turnover contributes minimally to myelin modulation in human white matter, which is mainly carried out by mature OLs [<xref rid="B32-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A single OL myelinates 20&#8211;60 axons [<xref rid="B41-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and the energetic demand for this process of myelination in early life is enormous. OLs meet this internal demand through glucose and fatty acid oxidation [<xref rid="B42-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] performed in numerous mitochondria [<xref rid="B43-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] that diminish once myelination is completed. Myelin sheaths continue to turn over in adult life to maintain the balance between myelin synthesis and degradation [<xref rid="B44-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Activity-regulated myelination appears to play a major role in tuning the function of neural networks and maladaptive myelination could contribute to disease mechanisms by promoting pathological patterns of neuronal activity [<xref rid="B45-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The other prominent role of OLs is the supply of energy substrates&#8212;lactate, glucose, ketones&#8212;to axons through myelinic channels [<xref rid="B46-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] to feed oxidative axon metabolism [<xref rid="B47-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] that neurons cannot ensure. Throughout the whole lifespan, long axons require an abundant and steady supply of metabolites from external sources to maintain signal transduction. Both large axonal tracts that run in the optic nerve or motor or sensory tracts of the spinal cord and small caliber axons are vulnerable to energy deprivation [<xref rid="B47-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. OLs and axons also have a reciprocal signaling relationship in which OLs receive cues from axons that direct their myelination, and OLs subsequently shape axonal structure and conduction. OLs detect fast axonal spiking through K+ signaling, making acute metabolic coupling possible and adjusting the axon&#8211;OL metabolic unit to meet axonal demand [<xref rid="B50-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In turn, metabolically active OLs contribute to information processing in addition to speeding up conduction velocity [<xref rid="B51-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Neuronal activity causes the axonal release of glutamate, inducing NMDA receptor signaling in OLs, which leads to surface expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and an increased glycolytic flux that increases the supply of pyruvate and lactate to axons via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) [<xref rid="B47-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Glutamate also stimulates glucose uptake from OLs to axons [<xref rid="B52-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the release of OL exosomes and the transfer of SIRT2 to the axonal compartment, where deacetylase stimulates mitochondrial ATP generation [<xref rid="B47-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A high content of peroxisomes provides OLs with an energy source from fatty acid &#946;-oxidation [<xref rid="B42-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and with essential neuroprotection against axon degeneration and neuroinflammation [<xref rid="B53-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Besides their close structural and functional interactions with axons, OLs have numerous interactions with other glial cells. Indeed, O initiate crosstalking with astrocytes via direct cell&#8211;cell contact as well as via secreted cytokines, chemokines, exosomes, and signaling molecules [<xref rid="B54-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. OLs also crosstalk with microglia, have immune functions, express a wide variety of innate immune receptors, and produce and respond to chemokines and cytokines that modulate immune responses of the CNS [<xref rid="B56-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Indeed, OLs interact with neighboring immune cells by expressing cytokines (IL-1b, IL-17A, CCL2), chemokines (C-X-C motif chemokine ligands, CXCL-1, CXCL10, CXCL12), antigen-presenting molecules (MHC-I, II), complement and complement receptor molecules (C1, C1q, C3) and complement regulatory molecules (CD46, CD55) [<xref rid="B57-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. OLs also express the chemokine receptors CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4 [<xref rid="B61-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Through these multiple effectors and pathways, OLs contribute to protecting CNS homeostasis and neuronal integrity from neuroinflammation, demyelination, and degeneration [<xref rid="B60-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B64-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].

Contribution of Oligodendrocytes to CNS Diseases</title><p>Since CNS diseases are numerous and diverse, this review will illustrate Ols&#8217; contribution with some examples. These examples include defects in single Mendelian genes known to cause pathology through loss-of-function (Canavan disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, X-ALD, spinal muscular atrophy, SMA) or gain-of-function (Huntington&#8217;s disease, HD) that affect cell types where the function of the normal gene product is physiologically important. In another broader category of non-Mendelian CNS diseases, the dysfunction or loss of distinct neuronal populations is due to a combination of multigenic predisposition and yet unknown environmental factors. This is the case for sporadic PD, multiple system atrophy (MSA), AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS), while psychiatric diseases are grouped in a distinct category of CNS disorders for which the molecular/cellular substratum remains unknown. This review will also briefly cite hypoxic&#8211;ischemic disorders occurring in premature newborns and old adults, as well as traumatic spinal cord injury.</p><p>We still do not know in which cell type(s) the primary mechanisms that cause a specific CNS disease are initiated. For most diseases, this question remains unanswered, even when the causal defect is known, as in monogenic disorders. The date of onset of the deleterious processes at the cellular level is also unknown. As astonishing as it seems, although PD, AS, and HD are thought of as late-onset diseases, they might instead be considered neurodevelopmental disorders with an early embryonic onset [<xref rid="B68-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>Given the complexity of the brain microenvironment, it is not easy to implicate OLs in the pathophysiology of most neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). It is even more difficult, however, to exonerate them, given their close interactions with axons and other glial cells across the various stages of CNS development and aging. Indeed, OL dysfunctions can alter axon myelination in early life, deprive neuro-axonal metabolism of precious energy substrates in the mature brain, or disturb the multiple crosstalks of OLs with other glial cells over the whole life.</p><p>The current review focuses on some CNS disorders involving or possibly involving OLs in the development of their shared [<xref rid="B69-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] or specific pathology.

Unfortunately, the precise translation of the optimal treatment timing from animal models to patients is often challenging, due to differences in disease mechanisms, CNS development, and lifespan across species. A particular and rare case is that of diseases that are identified near birth thanks to neonatal screening, opening the door to a preventive effect of gene therapy for diseases that manifest later in life, such as AMN.</p><p>The AAV capsid should be able to reach and transduce targeted neural cells. The serotype can influence its ability to do so. Indeed, capsid composition and structure determine cell surface receptor binding.

Diverse AAV serotypes and variants with high retrograde and/or anterograde transport properties have been described in the last few years [<xref rid="B197-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>].</p><p>The affinity and transduction efficiency of a given AAV variant in different cell types may vary among species. This is why any novel capsid should be tested in both NHPs and mice to better predict its translatability to humans. Translation is particularly challenging when a capsid works in NHPs but not in the mouse disease model.</p><p>The choice of a promoter able to activate a therapeutic transgene in specific target cells is critical. The ubiquitous promoters, such as CAG, CBA, CBh or CMV promoters widely used in CNS gene therapy, have a robust track record of efficiency. They are active in neurons and astrocytes but poorly active in OLs. In recent years, cell-specific or cell tropic promoters have emerged in gene therapy [<xref rid="B19-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to ensure expression in a given cell type. Such regulatory cassettes need to induce a therapeutic level of transgene expression without having to use a potentially toxic vector dose. Promoters designed to target specific subsets of cells have shown success in mouse or primate studies, but to our knowledge, no clinical trials using such promoters have yet been performed for CNS diseases.</p><p>Adverse events resulting from CNS gene therapy are outside the scope of the current article.

OL as Attractive Targets for CNS Gene Therapy</title><p>As long as ubiquitous promoters were used to equip AAV9 vectors, neurons and astrocytes were abundantly transduced, while the capacity of vectors to transduce OLs remained in question. For example, high intravenous doses of an AAV9 vector equipped with a CMV promoter were able to transduce many OLs in the brain and spinal cord of adult mice and marmoset, together with neurons and astrocytes in adult mice [<xref rid="B13-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. (Note that transduction was evaluated only two weeks after vector injection). In contrast, very high doses of a comparable vector iv injected to mouse neonates at P1 did not transduce OLs significantly, presumably because OL progenitor cells (OPCs) divide too rapidly at this age to allow persistence of extra-chromosomal gene copies in the oligodendroglial lineage [<xref rid="B16-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B338-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">338</xref>,<xref rid="B339-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">339</xref>].

OL transduction was not studied after intracerebral injection to adult mice [<xref rid="B24-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], intracisternal injection to cynomolgus macaques [<xref rid="B15-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or intraputaminal injection to two rhesus macaques [<xref rid="B18-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Based on these studies, OLs have sometimes been wrongly considered resistant to AAV gene therapy and were almost completely left behind in the gene therapy pipeline, for reasons that are no longer justified. Indeed, mature OLs hold promise not only for the treatment of CNS diseases considered to involve white matter like CD, X-ALD and MS but also for conditions where pathology of OLs and myelin has been described, such as PD, AD, ALS, HD and psychiatric diseases. It should be noted that mature OLs arise only at P7-P10 in mice, opening the door to durable transgene expression. After this age, the slow turnover of mature OLs allows AAV-carried transgene copies to persist in mouse OLs [<xref rid="B340-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">340</xref>], and presumably in humans whose OL turnover is even slower. For NDDs associated with aging in humans and mice, the durability of transgene expression should be assessed in the long term, while preclinical studies often report transduced cell counts only 2&#8211;3 weeks after vector administration [<xref rid="B301-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">301</xref>,<xref rid="B303-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">303</xref>,<xref rid="B341-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">341</xref>], with few exceptions [<xref rid="B340-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">340</xref>].</p><sec id="sec6dot1-cells-13-01973"><title>6.1.

Such properties are due to vector capsids and promoters. AAV capsids attach to extracellular glycans (e.g., glycoproteins, glycolipids) prior to cell entry [<xref rid="B342-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">342</xref>,<xref rid="B343-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">343</xref>].

We were also unable to find information on the AAV receptors present on the OL membrane. All natural AAV capsids do not show primary OL tropism. A small number of natural AAV serotypes can transduce OLs when equipped with ubiquitous promoters, but the transduction efficiency is low [<xref rid="B345-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">345</xref>], as for AAV8 or AAV9 carrying a CMV promoter [<xref rid="B346-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">346</xref>,<xref rid="B347-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">347</xref>] or a CBA promoter [<xref rid="B348-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">348</xref>].

Initial studies used the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter. A 1.9 kb Mbp promoter was able to drive GFP expression in OLs in the mouse brain but not in neurons, astrocytes or microglia [<xref rid="B345-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">345</xref>,<xref rid="B350-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">350</xref>,<xref rid="B351-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">351</xref>,<xref rid="B352-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">352</xref>].

However, while the Mbp promoter targets OLs, its relatively large size limits its use. The nucleotide sequences of the human and murine MBP proximal promoter regions are approximately 90% identical [<xref rid="B356-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">356</xref>], thus suggesting that the proximal human MBP promoter would be active in rodent cells.

Three constructs placed GFP under the control of either a 2.2 kb MAG promoter or truncated 1.5 and 0.3 kb fragments. Transgene GFP expression in OLs represented 98.4% of transduced cells with the 2.2 kb promoter and 90.7% with the 0.3 kb promoter, so that 65% of OLs were transduced with the 2.2 kb promoter and 57% with the 0.3 kb promoter.

The observed lack of effect was unexpected, particularly because the two-fold increase in MCT1 protein at disease onset was beneficial in another mutated SOD1 mouse ALS model [<xref rid="B372-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">372</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot2dot4-cells-13-01973"><title>6.2.4. Several Non-Mendelian CNS Diseases</title><p>Several CNS diseases in the absence of a single gene defect may respond only to a gene addition strategy. This strategy requires the expression of genes that are not physiologically present in OLs but can improve neuronal health or inhibit disease mechanisms. The choice of such a therapeutic transgene is challenging and can be guided by previous experiments using neurotropic or astrotropic vectors to deliver growth factors or cytokines or enzymes by transduced OLs. Compared with neurons or astrocytes, OLs might produce higher amounts of growth factors or cytokines, which could be tested in mouse or NHP models. An already mentioned difficulty is the need to reach OLs in the spatially defined regions specifically affected by the diseases [<xref rid="B373-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">373</xref>]. AD and neuropsychiatric diseases are associated with hypometabolism [<xref rid="B374-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">374</xref>], white matter [<xref rid="B375-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">375</xref>,<xref rid="B376-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">376</xref>] and myelin abnormalities [<xref rid="B377-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">377</xref>]. For this reason, improving the oligodendroglial oxidative metabolism of OLs could help prevent irreversible axon degeneration.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Multiple System atrophy (MSA)</italic>. Prominent mechanisms involve synuclein-associated protein aggregates that accumulate in OLs. These aggregates are thought to elicit changes in OL function, such as reduced neurotrophic support and demyelination, leading to neurodegeneration. To reverse this deleterious cascade, gene therapy should introduce a therapeutic gene able to support failing cell functions.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD).</italic> We have previously seen that the neuron-targeted delivery of genes encoding GDNF, NRTN, BDNF and CDNF could yield positive results in mouse models. It would be worth testing whether such production could be increased using OLs instead of neuron transduction. Transduced OLs could also act through their myelin-independent role in supporting glutamate signaling [<xref rid="B378-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">378</xref>], potentially impacting neurodegeneration [<xref rid="B379-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">379</xref>]. Mounting evidence suggests that neuron-released protein aggregates are central to microglial activation, which in turn orchestrates neuroinflammatory processes potentially harmful to neurons [<xref rid="B380-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">380</xref>]. The production of anti-inflammatory cytokines by transduced OLs could be used to inhibit pathomechanisms linked to innate inflammation [<xref rid="B381-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">381</xref>]. Two ideal objectives of gene therapy in PD would be to reduce the accumulation of protein aggregates by using OLs to influence the metabolic and internal milieu of neurons or to improve dopamine synthesis using the transduction of OLs, but finding transgenes to achieve this goal seems currently out of reach.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD)</italic>. We previously discussed the deleterious role that OLs seemed to play in AD. The structural integrity of myelin deteriorates with age, and this deterioration appears to be exacerbated in AD. A recent study placed myelin defects upstream of amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) plaque formation [<xref rid="B382-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">382</xref>]. Targeting OLs to counteract mechanisms such as neuroinflammation [<xref rid="B383-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">383</xref>] or neuronal dysmetabolism in the hippocampus are potential objectives. Given the pathogenic role of protein aggregates in AD [<xref rid="B74-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], as in PD, it is difficult to find a gene whose expression in OLs would reduce the accumulation of these aggregates in affected hippocampal neurons. Increasing the supply of energy fuels to neurons and axons could be an objective of gene therapy since AD is associated with an energy deficit [<xref rid="B49-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The reduction in OL MCT1 that occurs with aging may increase the risk of axonal degeneration in NDDs, including AD [<xref rid="B384-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">384</xref>]. Transducing OLs with the <italic toggle="yes">GDNF, BDNF</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">NGF</italic> genes may provide a local source of these factors that are altered in AD [<xref rid="B332-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">332</xref>,<xref rid="B385-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">385</xref>]. Cholesterol regulation in OLs could be another target of gene therapy [<xref rid="B123-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Since OLs contribute to A&#946; plaque formation in AD through highly expressed amyloidogenic genes, identifying the mechanisms that slow down A&#946; generation in OLs would pave the way for novel gene therapies [<xref rid="B386-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">386</xref>]. The complement system is a tightly regulated innate immune system playing a key role in regulating CNS function and development. C5aR1, the receptor of the C5a complement factor, is expressed by clusters of OLs during the complex cellular phase of AD initiated by C5aR1-induced secreted mediators [<xref rid="B387-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">387</xref>]. C5aR1 inhibition reduces plaque load, gliosis and memory deficits in animal models and could thus serve as a target for gene therapy of OLs [<xref rid="B388-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">388</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Multiple sclerosis</italic> (MS) is another disease that could benefit from OL-targeting gene therapy.</p><p>Surprisingly, gene therapy has not been mentioned in recent reviews of innovative MS treatments or remyelination strategies [<xref rid="B389-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">389</xref>,<xref rid="B390-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">390</xref>,<xref rid="B391-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">391</xref>,<xref rid="B392-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">392</xref>,<xref rid="B393-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">393</xref>], and new attempts have used AAV vectors in animal models [<xref rid="B394-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">394</xref>], which are poorly representative of the human disease [<xref rid="B395-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">395</xref>]. In active demyelinating lesions, the preserved number of mature OLs suggests a relative preservation of OLs, in contrast to the significant loss of OLs in the chronic lesions linked with disease progression [<xref rid="B396-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">396</xref>,<xref rid="B397-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">397</xref>,<xref rid="B398-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">398</xref>]. This supports that mature OLs could be used as target cells for gene therapy in the initial stage of relapsing MS. A variety of transgenes could be tested at this stage to promote OL survival and limit immune-mediated CNS demyelination [<xref rid="B399-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">399</xref>]. One could, again, try to improve energy metabolism of OLs [<xref rid="B137-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>].

Distinctive Challenges of OL-Targeting Gene Therapy</title><p>Just because targeting OLs is a new strategy, this does not mean that it will ensure the success of gene therapy in CNS diseases. The technical and biological challenges are numerous.</p><p>Technically, it will be necessary to develop highly oligotropic capsids and promoters that strongly express therapeutic transgenes in OLs. Promising examples of both have been cited in <xref rid="sec6dot1-cells-13-01973" ref-type="sec">Section 6.1</xref>. The technology for creating recombinant capsids capable of prioritizing the targeting of cell populations is under active development [<xref rid="B193-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. To our knowledge, OLs have not yet been included among the tested cell types, but this is likely to occur when OLs become targets of choice. For the design of promoters activated in OLs, this will be achieved by manipulating the promoters or other regulatory sequences of myelin synthesis genes, an example of which is shown in <xref rid="cells-13-01973-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>The biological challenges are more formidable and will rely on OL functions capable of interfering with the pathophysiological mechanisms of CNS diseases. In several areas, transducing OLs with AAV vectors may play an original and distinctive role. The first is the restoration of biochemical pathways specific to OLs. Another one is the synthesis of myelin and sheath enwrapment for CNS diseases that involve defects in myelination, such as genetic leukodystrophies, WMD of prematurity, and diseases like AD or HD that show defects in white matter in their early stages. A third field of action for transduced OLs is the supply of energy fuels to axons, since axons suffer from an energy deficit in many diseases such as AD [<xref rid="B42-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] or other NDDs of aging [<xref rid="B374-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">374</xref>]. As alterations in brain cholesterol homeostasis are linked to neurodegeneration, another metabolic objective could be to modify OL cholesterol metabolism and local cholesterol load white matter, for example in MS [<xref rid="B413-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">413</xref>] or HD [<xref rid="B370-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">370</xref>] or SCA [<xref rid="B367-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">367</xref>]. Another approach is to make OL factories of growth factors, chemokines or cytokines. AAV gene therapy expressing growth factor genes, in neurons or astrocytes, ultimately had only a limited clinical effect, described in <xref rid="sec6-cells-13-01973" ref-type="sec">Section 6</xref>. OL transduction might provide stronger local trophic support to neurons through a more abundant production of growth factors [<xref rid="B414-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">414</xref>]. OL production of anti-inflammatory cytokines may limit neuroinflammation in MS, AD or other diseases. OL production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL10, could also combat rejection of grafted NPCs by the local immune system [<xref rid="B411-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">411</xref>]. Other major pathophysiological mechanisms will not be easy to counteract through OL targeting, such as the prion-like propagation of protein aggregates in synucleinopathies or the defect in dopamine synthesis in neurons of the nigro-striatal circuit. There are still many unknowns in the temporal sequence and interactions of the pathological mechanisms responsible for PD [<xref rid="B115-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], AD [<xref rid="B415-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">415</xref>] or other CNS diseases [<xref rid="B416-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">416</xref>]. Shared alterations in gene expression in OLs across pathologies might indicate pathology-associated pathways that have not yet been explored in the search for therapies [<xref rid="B69-cells-13-01973" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].

These studies may reveal new avenues for OL gene therapy, given the multiple cross-talks between OLs and neurons, axons, astrocytes, microglia, ependymal and endothelial cells.</p><p>In conclusion, OLs deserve to be targets more often for gene therapy in a variety of CNS disorders, given their distinctive functions and properties (<xref rid="cells-13-01973-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This is the case for diseases caused or aggravated by OL dysfunctions. Therapeutic transgenes expressed in OLs can replace or silence defective OL genes or counteract pathological mechanisms occurring in other cells. During the early phase of brain or spinal cord diseases, the multiple crosstalks of transduced OLs could protect the CNS from defects in myelination, metabolic failure and neuroinflammation. In advanced stages of CNS diseases, when neuronal loss has occurred, surviving OLs might still express genes that prepare brain regions for NPC grafting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors of this review apologize to the authors of important articles that they did not cite note.
