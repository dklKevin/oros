There are more than 7,000 rare diseases affecting 30 million Americans, i.e., about 10% of the population. There are several hundred million patients around the world, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders. Two-thirds of the patients are children. Currently, there are no effective therapies for more than 95 percent of these patients. The few drug-based treatments approved for genetic diseases at best manage or modify symptoms. However, they do not address the underlying genetic cause of the disease. Thus, these drugs must be administered for life.</p><p id="p0015">Hundreds of researchers have dedicated their life to the pursuit of what initially appeared as an impossible dream: the development of gene therapies for hereditary diseases, i.e., a one-time curative repair or change to an individual&#8217;s affected gene that minimizes or even eliminates the symptoms for the entire life of the patient. This dream is now a reality: gene therapy greatly improves the outlook for currently incurable hereditary diseases!</p><p id="p0020">This review is limited to gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) because the gene delivered by this vector does not integrate into the patient genome.</p><p id="p0025">Glybera was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2012 as the first AAV-mediated gene therapy to reach this milestone. Glybera corrected hereditary lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD), which manifests as pancreatitis, recurrent abdominal pain, and eruptive fat-filled spots that result from very high triglyceride levels. However, the rarity of the disease (1 per million), the cost to the patient, and the expense to maintain therapeutic readiness by the company made it very difficult to continue gene delivery commercially. This form of gene therapy was no longer made available after 2018, at which time, only 31 people in the world had been treated.</p><p id="p0030">There are now five treatments approved for commercialization and are currently available, i.e., Luxturna, Zolgensma, the two chimeric antigen receptor T&#160;cell (CAR-T) therapies (Yescarta and Kymriah), and Strimvelis (the gammaretrovirus approved for adenosine deaminase-severe combined immunodeficiency [ADA-SCID] in Europe).

Following approval, noteworthy events include the continued long-term monitoring of subjects enrolled in the START trial.

Whereas many factors contribute to AAV&#8217;s tropism, transduction efficiency, and associated immune response in retina, route of delivery is especially critical. A summary of current and developing approaches, their advantages and disadvantages, and relevant clinical examples are discussed below.</p><sec id="sec1.3.1"><title>Subretinal Injection (SRI)</title><p id="p0200">SRI is employed in the majority of clinical trials because it allows for placement of the therapeutic <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> (in a surgically created space between photoreceptors (PRs) and RPE referred to as a subretinal &#8220;bleb&#8221;). The majority of IRDs are caused by mutations in PR-specific genes. In addition to its proximity to the most common clinical target cells (i.e., RPE and PR), SRI is attractive because of this compartment&#8217;s immune privilege. Unlike systemically delivered AAV, subretinally delivered vectors elicit a relatively reduced immune response akin to anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID).<xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr"><sup>93</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr"><sup>94</sup></xref> However, SRI is a challenging technique, described as &#8220;almost a subspecialty unto itself.&#8221;<xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr"><sup>95</sup></xref> It requires a vitrectomy (removal of vitreous humor) and retinotomy (passage of needle through the retina), which can be associated with complications, such as retinal tears, cataract progression, or retinal/choroidal hemmorage.<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr"><sup>96</sup></xref> Creation of the subretinal bleb requires detaching retina from the underlying RPE.

Another surgical consideration is the inherent difficulty of uniform and accurate volume delivery associated with the current transvitreal subretinal delivery method. Vector volume can be affected by use of a BSS pre-bleb, loss of vector from vitreous egress from retinotomy site, and incomplete target vector volume delivery due to surgeon discretion (concern for foveal stretching or macular hole formation or other safety considerations). In clinical trials where dose-escalation decisions are being made with small numbers of subjects, it may be challenging to appropriately make safety or efficacy decisions unless confirmation of precise and uniform vector volume delivery can be achieved in all patients dosed.</p><p id="p0210">It is also important to note that, despite its relative immune privilege, AAV vectors are still capable of reaching an adverse effect level and eliciting host-cell responses in the subretinal space.

For any gene therapy to be successful, sufficient therapeutic transgene expression (e.g., protein) levels must be achieved at doses that do not cause unmanageable inflammation. Ideally, a sufficient range between the minimum effective dose in animal models and the NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) should exist such that a phase I/II dose-escalation study can be performed. Logic dictates IRDs caused by defects in retinal proteins expressed at relatively low levels may be more easily addressed by gene therapy. A comparison of preclinical findings in large animal models of IRD versus clinical outcomes supports this concept, although published clinical outcomes remain scant to date.

An example is whether detachment of the cone-exclusive fovea via SRI is advisable.

In the latter scenario, SRI of AAVs capable of laterally spreading beyond the margin of detachment may mediate therapeutic levels of gene expression in foveal cones while avoiding the risks associated with foveal detachment.

Fortunately, we have at our disposal a constantly improving set of tools (e.g., AAV capsids), delivery approaches, and diagnostic technologies that are likely to enable this endeavor.
