Introduction</title><p>Protein modifications, particularly post-translational modifications (PTMs), represent a fundamental biological phenomenon wherein proteins undergo covalent alterations after their synthesis. To clarify the scope of this review, while our primary focus is on classical enzymatic PTMs&#8212;such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, methylation, SUMOylation, acetylation, crotonylation, and redox modifications&#8212;we also selectively include certain non-enzymatic covalent modifications (e.g., formaldehyde-derived adducts) and RNA modifications (e.g., m<sup>6</sup>A, m<sup>5</sup>C). This broader scope is justified by their growing relevance in regulatory biology and biosensing, their mechanistic parallels to PTMs, and their emerging roles as biomarkers detectable via similar sensing platforms. These modifications profoundly expand the functional repertoire and structural diversity of the proteome beyond the genetic code, enabling proteins to modulate a wide array of physiological processes. PTMs encompass over 650 distinct types, each contributing uniquely to protein function. By altering protein conformation, stability, localization, activity, and interactions, PTMs serve as critical regulators of cellular signaling, metabolism, gene expression, and immune responses [<xref rid="B1-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The dynamic and reversible nature of many PTMs allows cells to rapidly adapt to environmental cues and maintain homeostasis. Conversely, dysregulation of PTMs is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases [<xref rid="B1-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The biological significance of PTMs extends to diverse molecular mechanisms. For example, phosphorylation modulates enzyme activity and signal transduction cascades; ubiquitination governs protein degradation and trafficking; glycosylation influences protein folding and cell&#8211;cell communication; and methylation impacts chromatin remodeling and gene transcription [<xref rid="B1-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Emerging PTMs such as crotonylation, succinylation, and lactylation have been identified with distinct functional roles, highlighting the complexity of the PTM landscape [<xref rid="B5-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Notably, PTMs can act in concert and engage in intricate crosstalk, where one modification influences the addition, removal, or functional outcome of another. This hierarchical and combinatorial regulation adds an additional layer of biological control and complexity [<xref rid="B7-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Advances in proteomic technologies, including mass spectrometry-based approaches, have facilitated the high-throughput identification and quantification of PTMs, enabling comprehensive profiling of modification patterns across physiological and pathological states [<xref rid="B8-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In the context of disease diagnosis, PTMs hold considerable promise as biomarkers and therapeutic targets, as their altered patterns faithfully reflect disease onset, progression, and therapeutic response. The diagnostic utility of specific PTMs is evident across a spectrum of diseases. In oncology, for instance, aberrant phosphorylation and acetylation of histone proteins are hallmarks of epigenetic dysregulation and cancer development [<xref rid="B3-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B10-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while disease-specific alterations in protein glycosylation on cell surfaces and secreted proteins modulate tumor&#8211;immune interactions and serve as established biomarkers for various cancers and inflammatory disorders [<xref rid="B11-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Beyond cancer, PTMs are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, where modifications such as S-nitrosylation and oxidative PTMs contribute to protein misfolding and neuronal damage [<xref rid="B12-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, in metabolic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, PTMs exert precise control over key metabolic enzymes and signaling pathways, directly influencing pathophysiology and presenting opportunities for intervention [<xref rid="B4-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B14-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the relevance of PTMs extends to infectious diseases, where host- or pathogen-mediated modifications of viral proteins can critically modulate infection cycles and immune evasion strategies, underscoring their diagnostic value [<xref rid="B16-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Biosensing technologies have evolved as powerful tools for detecting PTMs and their associated proteins, facilitating early diagnosis and monitoring of diseases. Biosensors integrate a biorecognition element with a transducer to convert a biological interaction into a measurable signal. Among various biosensing platforms, optical biosensors, including surface plasmon resonance (SPR), evanescent wave-based sensors, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors, have gained prominence due to their label-free, real-time, and highly sensitive detection capabilities [<xref rid="B17-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. SPR biosensors, for example, have been extensively applied in medical diagnostics to analyze biomolecular interactions and detect clinically relevant analytes such as proteins, nucleic acids, viruses, and exosomes [<xref rid="B17-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B20-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The integration of nanomaterials, such as graphene, carbon dots, and silk-based matrices, has further enhanced biosensor performance by improving biocompatibility, sensitivity, and stability [<xref rid="B21-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Recent advancements also include the development of wearable, flexible, and implantable biosensors that enable continuous monitoring of physiological parameters, facilitating personalized healthcare and early disease detection [<xref rid="B20-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B24-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The convergence of biosensing with machine learning and artificial intelligence is poised to revolutionize data analysis and interpretation, enabling more precise and rapid diagnostics [<xref rid="B18-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B26-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Despite these advances, challenges remain in biosensor miniaturization, stability, specificity in complex biological matrices, and regulatory compliance for clinical translation [<xref rid="B27-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Addressing these challenges is critical to fully realizing the potential of biosensors in medical diagnostics.</p><p>In summary, protein modifications are central to biological regulation and disease pathogenesis, with significant implications for diagnostics. The synergy between advances in understanding PTMs and biosensor technologies offers unprecedented opportunities for sensitive, specific, and rapid detection of disease biomarkers. Continued interdisciplinary research integrating proteomics, chemistry, materials science, and bioengineering will drive the development of next-generation biosensors, overcoming existing challenges and enabling transformative applications in medical diagnostics and personalized medicine.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-biosensors-16-00021"><title>2.

Phosphorylation</title><p>Phosphorylation is a fundamental PTM involving the covalent attachment of a phosphate group, typically to serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues of proteins. This reversible modification, catalyzed by kinases and reversed by phosphatases, induces conformational changes that regulate protein activity, localization, stability, and interactions, thereby modulating diverse cellular processes. Mechanistically, phosphorylation alters the electrostatic properties and steric configuration of target proteins, enabling or disabling their interactions within signaling cascades. For instance, phosphorylation of kinase proteins triggers conformational rearrangements that activate or inhibit their catalytic functions, serving as molecular switches in signal transduction pathways. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway exemplifies this, where phosphorylation of MEK1 at specific residues (S218 and S222) by RAF kinases induces conformational changes essential for ATP binding and substrate phosphorylation, propagating oncogenic signals (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) [<xref rid="B29-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Advanced biosensor technologies, such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors, have been developed to monitor phosphorylation dynamics in living cells, providing spatiotemporal resolution of kinase activities and downstream signaling events (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B) [<xref rid="B30-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, phosphorylation-driven protein switches have been engineered to respond rapidly and reversibly to kinase activity, facilitating real-time biosensing and synthetic biology applications (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C) [<xref rid="B32-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These biosensors exploit the intrinsic conformational shifts induced by phosphorylation, underscoring the centrality of phosphorylation in cellular communication and its amenability to quantitative detection. The complexity of phosphorylation is further highlighted by proximal multi-site phosphorylation, where clusters of phosphosites cooperatively modulate protein conformation and function, influencing signal integration and gene expression (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D) [<xref rid="B33-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Collectively, phosphorylation orchestrates signal transduction by modulating protein structure and interactions, and its dynamic regulation is critical for cellular homeostasis and response to environmental stimuli.</p><p>Aberrant phosphorylation patterns are hallmark features of numerous diseases, notably cancer, where dysregulated kinase activity drives oncogenic signaling, tumor progression, and metastasis. Phosphorylation serves as a sensitive biomarker reflecting the activation state of signaling pathways and the presence of pathological processes. For example, oncogenic mutations in kinases such as BRAF and MEK1 alter their phosphorylation states and conformations, which can be monitored using kinase conformation biosensors to evaluate drug efficacy and mutation-driven activity changes in live cells [<xref rid="B29-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B34-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The development of phosphoproteomic databases like PhosCancer consolidates extensive phosphorylation site data across multiple cancer types, facilitating the identification of clinically actionable phosphosites and their associations with cancer hallmarks (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E) [<xref rid="B35-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Biosensors leveraging phosphorylation-specific recognition elements enable sensitive detection of phosphorylated proteins, such as kinases and their substrates, in complex biological samples, offering rapid and minimally invasive diagnostic tools (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F) [<xref rid="B36-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Nanostructured electrode platforms have been engineered to amplify electrochemical signals for detecting phosphorylated oncogenic proteins like BRAF with enhanced sensitivity, supporting their potential clinical application in cancer diagnostics [<xref rid="B38-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, phosphorylation of peptides and proteins can be exploited to design anti-fouling biosensor interfaces, improving detection accuracy in biological fluids, and molecular simulation (MS) illustrated that, compared with the -COOH and -NH<sub>2</sub> groups, the -PO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub> group formed the most numbers of hydrogen bonds and stronger hydrogen bonds with water molecules (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G) [<xref rid="B39-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Following a similar logic, we hypothesize that some modifications that introduce strong polar and multi-hydrogen bond sites (such as glycosylation and hydroxylation) can also be used to enhance the hydrophilicity of natural peptides. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD), phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau), particularly at specific residues like threonine 217 and 181, have emerged as robust biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease progression monitoring. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid assays detecting p-tau isoforms demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity, outperforming traditional biomarkers and correlating with pathological hallmarks observed via PET imaging [<xref rid="B40-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The pathological phosphorylation of tau also impairs its proteolytic degradation, contributing to biomarker accumulation and disease pathology [<xref rid="B40-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similarly, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains serve as biomarkers for neurodegeneration, reflecting axonal damage in diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref rid="B43-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In infectious diseases, phosphorylation patterns of viral proteins and host kinases reveal virus&#8211;host interactions and may guide antiviral strategies [<xref rid="B44-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Collectively, phosphorylation-based biomarkers provide critical insights into disease mechanisms, enabling early detection, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring across a spectrum of diseases, with biosensor technologies advancing their clinical translation.</p><fig position="anchor" id="biosensors-16-00021-f001" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway [reprinted with permission from ref.

Acetylation</title><p>Acetylation is a pivotal PTM involving the covalent attachment of an acetyl group, typically to lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins. This modification profoundly influences protein function, stability, and interactions, thereby regulating diverse cellular processes. Central to gene expression regulation is histone acetylation, which neutralizes the positive charge on lysine residues within histone tails, diminishing histone&#8211;DNA interactions and resulting in a more relaxed chromatin structure. This chromatin decondensation facilitates the access of transcriptional machinery to DNA, promoting gene transcription. The dynamic balance between histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) governs this process, enabling fine-tuned control of gene expression patterns essential for cellular differentiation, proliferation, and response to environmental cues. Beyond histones, acetylation modulates the activity and interactions of transcription factors, signaling molecules, and metabolic enzymes, thereby integrating epigenetic regulation with broader cellular metabolic states. For instance, acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), a central metabolite, serves as the acetyl donor in acetylation reactions, linking cellular metabolism to epigenetic control. Recent advances have enabled the development of genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors capable of visualizing acetyl-CoA dynamics in live cells, revealing its compartmentalized metabolism and rapid fluctuations that may influence acetylation-dependent gene regulation (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A) [<xref rid="B45-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Furthermore, acetylation plays critical roles in pathological contexts such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, where aberrant acetylation patterns disrupt normal gene expression and cellular homeostasis. The integration of acetylation with other PTMs, such as methylation and phosphorylation, contributes to the complexity of the epigenetic landscape. Thus, acetylation constitutes a versatile and dynamic regulatory mechanism that modulates chromatin architecture and gene expression, with profound implications for cellular function and disease.</p><p>The clinical utility of acetylation as a biomarker and diagnostic target has gained increasing attention due to its direct involvement in gene regulation and disease pathogenesis. Detection of acetylation modifications, particularly histone acetylation states, offers insights into cellular epigenetic status and disease progression at early stages. Innovative biosensing technologies have been developed to monitor acetylation with high sensitivity and specificity. For example, aptamer-functionalized field effect transistors (FETs) combined with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors enable label-free, real-time detection of histone acetylation by quantifying changes in charge and mass upon acetylation of histone subunits, achieving detection limits below 100 nM (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) [<xref rid="B47-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This approach facilitates early diagnosis by allowing precise measurement of PTM alterations implicated in diseases such as cancer. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas systems have been engineered as switchable biosensors responsive to acetylation states; a switchable Cas12a system has been employed to detect histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity with sub-nanomolar sensitivity, enabling direct biochemical assays for enzyme function relevant to epigenetic dysregulation [<xref rid="B48-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Intact mass spectrometry combined with immunoaffinity purification has also been utilized to identify acetylated protein biomarkers, such as acetylated neuron-specific enolase, in human serum, highlighting its potential in tumor diagnosis (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C) [<xref rid="B49-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

The modulation of protein&#8211;ligand interactions by acetylation has also been explored using advanced biosensor platforms.

Glycosylation</title><p>Glycosylation, a complex and highly diverse PTM, involves the covalent attachment of carbohydrate moieties (glycans) to proteins, resulting in glycoproteins that are critical for a wide array of biological functions. This diversity arises from variations in glycan composition, branching, linkage types, and site-specific occupancy, which collectively generate a heterogeneous glycan landscape on protein surfaces. For instance, N-linked glycosylation, where glycans attach to asparagine residues, can produce thousands of distinct glycoforms due to differences in monosaccharide composition, sequence, and three-dimensional conformation, contributing to both macro- and microheterogeneity at glycosylation sites [<xref rid="B52-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Chao et al. designed a method that utilizes photo-degraded amino-modified graphene to covalently bind with the N-glycans in the serum glycoproteins of patients with liver cell carcinoma (HCC). This approach was used to capture the N-glycans. They found that there were significant differences in the N-glycan spectra between the serum samples of liver cancer patients and healthy individuals. These differences were manifested as an increase in the abundance and molecular weight of N-glycans. Through biomarker screening, an N-glycan with a <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> ratio of 1847.01 showed potential as a diagnostic biomarker for liver cancer [<xref rid="B53-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Detection of Protein Modifications in Food</title><p>The detection of protein modifications in food matrices plays a crucial role in ensuring food safety, authenticity, and allergen management. Protein modifications can arise naturally during processing or be induced by illicit additives, and their identification provides a molecular fingerprint for monitoring food quality and safety. For instance, formaldehyde (FA) is illegally added as a preservative in some food products, but its direct detection is challenging once the food is rinsed. A novel strategy based on permanent protein modifications induced by formaldehyde (PMIF) has been developed to detect FA addition in foods. By combining mass spectrometry with unrestrictive identification of protein modifications, four characteristic PMIFs were identified as markers for FA contamination, enabling detection even after thorough washing of food products (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A) [<xref rid="B161-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. This approach exemplifies how protein modifications serve as persistent indicators of chemical adulteration. Another application is in the detection of allergenic proteins in processed foods. Food processing can induce structural changes and covalent modifications in allergenic proteins, affecting their immunogenicity and detectability. For example, the conjugation of bioactive plant metabolites such as benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) to whey protein &#945;-lactalbumin alters its allergenic properties. BITC modification changes the protein&#8217;s secondary structure, surface hydrophobicity, and proteolytic stability, which can increase allergenicity due to exposure or formation of new epitopes (<xref rid="biosensors-16-00021-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B) [<xref rid="B162-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>,<xref rid="B163-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Detecting such modifications is essential for protecting sensitized individuals and improving allergen labeling accuracy. Mass spectrometry techniques, particularly MALDI-TOF/TOF, have been extensively employed for proteomic analysis of food allergens, providing detailed characterization of protein modifications induced by processing.

Detection Sensitivity and Specificity</title><p>The sensitivity and specificity of protein modification-based biosensors are critical for their use in biological sensing and clinical diagnostics. Although significant progress has been made, current technologies still face inherent limitations that affect detection performance. For example, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors enable label-free and highly sensitive detection but often require further improvement to detect low-abundance viral proteins in complex samples. Modifying SPR sensors with nanomaterials like graphene oxide (GO) can enhance sensitivity by offering abundant functional groups for biomolecule immobilization and improving biocompatibility. However, achieving ultra-low detection limits and high specificity in heterogeneous matrices remains challenging [<xref rid="B186-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Organic field-effect transistor (OFET)-based biosensors use organic semiconductor materials for signal amplification and label-free detection. Nevertheless, their performance is often affected by environmental factors and nonspecific binding, which reduces specificity and reproducibility [<xref rid="B187-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Electrochemical biosensors are widely employed for protein detection due to their high sensitivity and operational simplicity. Yet, they are prone to biofouling caused by nonspecific adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules. This fouling gradually degrades sensor stability and specificity [<xref rid="B76-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In semiconductor-based biosensors such as silicon nanowire field-effect transistors (SiNW-FETs), the Debye shielding effect considerably lowers sensitivity under physiological ionic strength. Overcoming this limitation often requires complex device designs or surface modifications [<xref rid="B188-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, detecting post-translational modifications (PTMs) like ubiquitination and glycosylation remains difficult due to their low abundance and dynamic nature.

The utility of a PTM as a biomarker is context-dependent, dictated by the biological nature of the disease. For dynamic, pathway-driven diseases like cancer, phosphorylation is often the marker of choice due to its rapid reversibility and pivotal position in cellular signaling networks. Aberrant phosphorylation patterns directly mirror the dysregulation of growth and survival pathways, providing a mechanistic explanation for disease progression and a quantifiable metric for treatment efficacy. In contrast, for pathologies involving chronic inflammation or long-term tissue remodeling, more stable modifications such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs) may serve as better cumulative markers of disease burden [<xref rid="B191-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. for viral infections, how glycosylation is key because viruses co-opt host machinery to shield epitopes and mediate entry, making glycan profiles both a pathogen-specific signature and an indicator of immune evasion [<xref rid="B192-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>].

Multiplexing and High-Throughput Strategies</title><p>To significantly enhance the multiplexing capability of protein modification detection, future platforms should explore integration with CRISPR-Cas systems. The programmability of CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs) can be harnessed to direct catalytically inactive Cas proteins (e.g., dCas9, dCas12) to specific genomic loci adjacent to genes encoding target proteins or to reporter constructs [<xref rid="B198-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. This spatial targeting enables the colocalization of multiple PTM-specific recognition elements (e.g., antibodies, nanobodies, or affimers), facilitating the simultaneous, spatially resolved detection of several PTMs on a single biosensor chip or in a microfluidic array. For instance, dCas proteins fused to different fluorescent proteins and targeted by unique gRNAs could provide a visual readout for concurrent monitoring of phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation events. However, this promising approach is not without limitations [<xref rid="B199-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. Off-target effects remain a primary concern, as imperfect gRNA matching may lead to the mislocalization of detection complexes, compromising specificity and generating false-positive signals in a multiplexed setting. Additionally, the simultaneous operation of multiple CRISPR-Cas systems may lead to steric hindrance and signal crosstalk, while the large size of Cas protein fusions could impact the kinetics and sensitivity of PTM binding. Addressing these challenges will require the engineering of high-fidelity Cas variants, optimized delivery strategies for in-cell sensing, and sophisticated computational tools for gRNA design and signal deconvolution [<xref rid="B200-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5dot3-biosensors-16-00021"><title>2.5.3. Clinical Translation of Applications</title><p>The translation of protein modification-based biosensors and diagnostic tools from laboratory research to clinical application faces multiple significant barriers. Firstly, the complexity of biological samples in clinical settings presents a formidable challenge. Biosensors developed under controlled laboratory conditions often encounter interference from biofoulants such as proteins, cells, polysaccharides, and lipids present in blood, saliva, or other bodily fluids, which can severely affect sensor reliability and stability [<xref rid="B76-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. This necessitates the development of robust antifouling strategies and surface modifications to maintain sensor performance in complex biofluids. Secondly, reproducibility and standardization remain critical issues. Many biosensors utilize nanomaterials like graphene, gold nanoparticles, or MXenes to enhance sensitivity and selectivity [<xref rid="B181-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>,<xref rid="B201-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>,<xref rid="B202-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>], but variability in synthesis, functionalization, and immobilization techniques can lead to inconsistent sensor performance. This complicates regulatory approval and clinical adoption. Thirdly, the integration of biosensors into user-friendly, cost-effective, and scalable platforms suitable for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics is still under development. While advanced biosensors such as nanostructured mesoporous gold electrodes have demonstrated excellent sensitivity for detecting phosphorylated proteins relevant to cancer [<xref rid="B38-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], their fabrication complexity and the need for specialized equipment limit widespread clinical use. Moreover, signal transduction mechanisms, including electrochemical, optical, and electrogenerated chemiluminescence methods, must be optimized for stability and minimal background noise in clinical environments [<xref rid="B119-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>,<xref rid="B203-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. Another barrier is the challenge of detecting PTMs with sufficient specificity and sensitivity. PTMs are often present in low abundance and can be transient or heterogeneous, complicating their reliable quantification. Mass spectrometry offers high accuracy but is costly and not conducive to rapid diagnostics [<xref rid="B204-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. Biosensor platforms must therefore balance sensitivity with operational simplicity. Furthermore, the Debye shielding effect in semiconductor biosensors can reduce detection sensitivity in physiological ionic strengths, necessitating innovative device architectures such as 3D stacked silicon nanosheet FETs to overcome this limitation [<xref rid="B188-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Finally, clinical validation requires extensive testing with diverse patient samples to establish diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and clinical utility. Many biosensors remain at the proof-of-concept stage, lacking large-scale clinical trials and regulatory approval pathways. The complexity of protein modifications, the need for multiplexed detection of biomarkers, and integration with data analytics and AI for interpretation further complicate translation efforts [<xref rid="B205-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. In summary, the barriers to clinical translation include biological sample complexity, reproducibility and standardization challenges, fabrication and operational complexity, sensitivity and specificity for PTMs, and the need for rigorous clinical validation and regulatory compliance. Addressing these obstacles is essential for the successful deployment of protein modification-based biosensors in clinical diagnostics.</p><p>Future research aimed at overcoming the translational barriers of protein modification-based biosensors should focus on several key areas.

Clinical translation also requires rigorous validation with patient-derived samples and standardization of protocols. The establishment of comprehensive databases and cloud computing resources for proteomic data, including PTMs and sequence variants, can facilitate biomarker discovery and validation [<xref rid="B211-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. Additionally, the design of biosensors compatible with point-of-care settings, including portable, low-cost, and user-friendly devices such as paper-based lateral flow immunoassays enhanced by AI-driven analysis, can accelerate clinical adoption [<xref rid="B205-biosensors-16-00021" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>].
