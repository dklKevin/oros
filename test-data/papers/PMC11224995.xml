</xref> According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CVD accounts for the majority of deaths caused by noncommunicable diseases, with approximately 17.9 million people affected annually (WHO, 2023). Approximately 85% of deaths related to CVDs are attributed to heart attacks and strokes (WHO, 2021), which are frequently triggered by blockages impeding blood flow to the heart or brain. These blockages are commonly associated with atherosclerosis.

This marked the first step toward gene therapy for genetic diseases based on CRISPR/Cas system. From 2012 to 2013, CRISPR/Cas technology made significant advancements, progressing from in vitro reconstruction to gene editing of human cells. This breakthrough has led to a surge in research on CRISPR/Cas technology, which continues to this day. The discovery and development of the CRISPR/Cas system have been accompanied by the unwavering enthusiasm of countless researchers, heralding a new era of gene editing technology and gene therapy for diseases, as depicted in Figure&#160;<xref rid="mco2639-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="mco2639-fig-0001" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>The discovery and development of the CRISPR/Cas system.

<sup>47</sup>
</xref> Currently, the most widely used gene editing system is CRISPR/Cas9, which is part of the Type II systems. Other commonly used editing tools include Cas12a and Cas12f, which belong to the Type V systems.</p><p>The CRISPR/Cas9 system consists of two main components: gRNA and Cas9 protein. gRNA is a small RNA molecule made up of crRNA and tracrRNA, which guides the binding to the target DNA site. The Cas9 protein is primarily composed of the recognition lobe (REC) and the nuclease lobe (NUC). The NUC lobe is made up of the RuvC, HNH, Wedge (WED), and PAM&#8208;interacting (PI) domains. The HNH domain is responsible for cleaving complementary chains, while the RuvC domain is responsible for cleaving noncomplementary chains. Once gRNA binds to its target site, it recruits Cas9 protein to cleave the DNA at that site. Different bacteria or archaea have different Cas9 proteins, such as SpCas9, SaCas9, FNCas9, and others. Currently, SpCas9 and its variants are extensively utilized as the Cas9 protein in numerous in vitro and in vivo experiments. In the realm of gene therapy, SaCas9 has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its compact size and convenient integration into delivery systems.</p><p>The CRISPR/Cas9 system is commonly used for gene editing by causing targeted double&#8208;stranded DNA breaks (DSBs).<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>48</sup>
</xref> These breaks can lead to a variety of human illnesses in mammalian cells, and the cells have developed mature repair mechanisms, including nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology&#8208;directed recombination.<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>49</sup>
</xref> The NHEJ repair mechanism is not always accurate in repairing DSBs in DNA. This inaccuracy can lead to the loss or addition of DNA sequences, causing frameshift mutations. CRISPR/Cas9 system uses the NHEJ repair mechanism to induce frameshift alterations or mutations in the target gene resulting in gene silencing.<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">

These include editing efficiency, off&#8208;targeting, PAM limitation, inefficient homologous recombination, and the need for miniaturization of tools. These issues need to be resolved urgently. Over the last decade, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has garnered significant attention and funding, leading to advancements in enhancing its usability, efficiency, and safety. As shown in Table&#160;<xref rid="mco2639-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, researchers have proposed numerous solutions to address the limitations and challenges and have consistently pursued iterative improvements.

The HNH and RuvC domains play a crucial role in cleaving the target site, thus determining the efficiency and outcomes of the entire system. Researchers have discovered additional applications for the system while striving to enhance its efficiency. The nCas9 and dCas9 systems were created by modifying the protein structure and deactivating one or both of the HNH and RuvC domains. This modification enables them to generate single&#8208;strand breaks or even lose the capability to cut DNA at the desired location. Consequently, this advancement has paved the way for various applications such as precise gene editing, base editing, gene composition imaging, and epigenetic regulation.</p><p>Indeed, a significant number of genetic diseases are known to be caused by mutations in DNA bases. However, conventional gene editing tools face challenges in achieving precise modifications to DNA, particularly in the case of point mutations. These tools often struggle to achieve the intended modifications accurately.

</xref> combined Cas9 technology with cytidine deaminase to obtain Cytidine Base Editor (CBE) in 2016. Under the guidance of sgRNA, rAPOBEC1, a cytosine deaminase derived from rats, binds to the designated site and converts cytosine (C) into uracil (U) within the editing window. Simultaneously, nCas9 is used to cut the nonedited DNA strand, and guanine (G) is replaced with adenine (A) through mismatch repair (MMR) to pair with U. Eventually, during DNA replication, U is transformed into thymine (T) to achieve base substitution. Additionally, uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) is included in the fusion protein to inhibit the host's intracellular uracil glycosylase activity. This prevents the modified U from being repaired through base&#8208;excision repair (BER) by the host, thereby improving the editing efficiency. In the same year, Kondo's team<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0073" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> The ecTadA could convert adenine (A) into inosine (I) within a specific editing window when it binds to a designated position. Inosine (I) possesses a structure that closely resembles guanine (G), causing the cell to read and replicate it as G. The base editing system improves the efficiency of preparing cellular and animal models of single&#8208;base mutations, making it a valuable tool for studying the pathogenesis and gene therapy of genetic diseases caused by single&#8208;gene single&#8208;point mutations.

These efforts have significantly enhanced the efficiency of base editing and minimized the risk of off&#8208;target effects. Liu's team<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0078" ref-type="bibr">

Scientists have fused base editors to enable two&#8208;base gene editing, allowing for the replacement of adjacent CA bases.<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0079" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> introduced the Prime Editing (PE) system, which significantly expanded the application range of base editors by combining nCas9 with reverse transcriptase (RT) and adaptively updated and optimized gRNA. The PE system is dependent on PE guide RNA (pegRNA). The 3&#8242; end of pegRNA contains a prime&#8208;binding site that pairs with the target DNA strand to be cleaved. It also has a RT template for reverse transcription by RT at the 3&#8242; end of the broken DNA single strand, which generates the edited sequence. Subsequently, the 5&#8242; end nuclease cuts the unedited 5&#8242; ssDNA, resulting in DNA editing. To enhance the editing efficiency, sgRNA matching the edited strand is utilized to create a second nick in the unedited complementary strand. This encourages DNA repair to preferentially replace the unedited strand. The PE method can achieve more precise and complex gene editing through point mutation or insertion&#8211;deletion mutation of reverse transcription templates.</p><p>However, the editing efficiency of the PE system is still low, and the design of pegRNA sequences is relatively complex.

However, the current approach still faces challenges in effectively inserting large fragments of DNA. To address this issue, researchers have introduced serine integrase, which enables targeted recombination between the attB element in the receptor genome and the attP element in the donor DNA. The process begins by preloading the att site into the genome using the PE system. Subsequently, the donor DNA, which contains complementary att sites, is inserted into the preinstalled sites using serine integrase. Two separate groups, David R. Liu and Jonathan S. Gootenberg, developed the twinPE and PASTE systems, respectively, based on this concept.<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0120" ref-type="bibr">

Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme reductase, thereby reducing lipid levels. However, there are still some patients who are intolerant to statins or do not achieve safe lipid levels even with the highest dose. The efficacy of statins can be affected by mutations in the ApoE gene, while mutations in the SLCO1B1 gene can reduce the liver's ability to uptake statins, leading to increased blood levels and a higher risk of rhabdomyolysis or other diseases.<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0191" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Similarly, other therapeutic drugs for CVD, such as anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and blood pressure&#8208;lowering agents, also face concerns regarding dosage, toxicity, and metabolism. Therefore, there is an urgent need for research and development of safer and more effective drugs for CVD. Targeting genetic mutations associated with CVD could be a more precise therapeutic strategy, as evidenced by the success of current antibody drugs, antisense nucleotide drugs, and siRNA drugs.</p><p>PCSK9 is a serine protease primarily secreted by liver cells and plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis. Inhibiting PCSK9 can effectively lower levels of low&#8208;density cholesterol (LDL&#8208;C). Currently, there are four approved drugs targeting PCSK9. These include Repatha (Evolocumab), a monoclonal antibody drug developed by Amgen; Praluent (Alirocumab), another monoclonal antibody drug developed by Sanofi and Regeneron; SINTBILO (Tafolecimab), a monoclonal antibody drug developed by Innovent; and Leqviq (Incisiran), a siRNA drug developed by Novartis.</p><p>ANGPTL3, a member of the angiopoietin&#8208;like protein family, plays a crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism.

Currently, the only approved drugs that target ApoC3 are Ionis&#8217; ASO drug Waylivra (Volanesorsen).

However, there are promising drugs in Phase III, such as Novartis&#8217; ASO drug Pelacarcen and Amgen's siRNA drug Olpasiran, which aim to target Lp(a) more safely and effectively.</p><p>In addition, the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR&#8208;CM) and DMD is also worth noting. ATTR&#8208;CM is caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene, resulting in the deposition of amyloid fibers outside the cells. This condition is characterized by progressive neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Currently, the only approved treatment for ATTR&#8208;CM is Pfzer's TTR tetramer stabilizer Vyndaqel (Tafamidis).

Patients with DMD experience inflammatory reactions shortly after birth, leading to muscle fibrosis, atrophy, and degeneration, ultimately resulting in respiratory and/or heart failure. Currently approved drugs for DMD treatment include Sarepta's ASO drugs Exodys 51 (Eteplarisen), Vyondys 53 (Golodirsen), and Amodys 45 (Casimersen), as well as NS Pharma's ASO drug Viltepso (Viltolarsen). These drugs work by mediating exon hopping to generate truncated, yet still functional, anti&#8208;muscular atrophy proteins. Additional approved drugs include PTC Therapeutics&#8217; corticosteroid drug Emflaza (Deflazacort) and the small molecule drug Translarna (Ataluren). Translarna can bind to the termination codon, allowing premature termination of mRNA to be read through and resulting in the production of full&#8208;length functional proteins.

AI&#8208;based rational design has made it possible to develop efficient and safe gene editing systems that do not exist naturally.</p><p>Based on existing research, PE systems demonstrate significant potential. However, as a user, there is an expectation for a more concise and clear usage scheme, which can be achieved through iterative evolution. This can facilitate the development of junior researchers or other related fields. As research progresses, we may witness the emergence of new targeting tools based on specific structures or gene modifications, moving beyond the early protein&#8208;based and current RNA&#8208;based targeting systems. Moreover, the exploration of gene editing systems has expanded from prokaryotes to eukaryotes,<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0182" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>182</sup>
</xref> which has opened up possibilities for future development in mammalian and even human gene editing systems. This could potentially address the immunogenicity concerns associated with current gene editing techniques.<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0255" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>255</sup>
</xref> Overall, the solid research foundation and the enthusiasm of researchers contribute to a promising future for gene editing technology.</p><p>The future of gene therapy requires more careful consideration. Currently, gene therapy heavily relies on advances in delivery methods, which have steadily progressed through the development of protein engineering, AI techniques, and the application of materials science. One potential development is the combination of existing AAV delivery systems, which rely on specific promoters, and protein delivery systems, which rely on specific receptors on the cell surface. This combination enables the creation of targeted modified viruses or completely artificial virus&#8208;like vectors. Additionally, incorporating human&#8208;derived materials into these designs may alleviate concerns about the safety of the gene editing treatment.</p><p>Despite the advantages of existing gene therapy programs as one&#8208;time treatments, their high cost remains a barrier for some patients. However, the modularity advantage of gene therapy programs, such as the CRISPR/Cas system, will allow for a significant reduction in the cost of designing future gene therapies. As clinical evaluation systems stabilize and gene therapy protocols become more widely adopted, personalized gene therapy protocols tailored to individuals are expected to become accessible at affordable prices.</p></sec></sec><sec id="mco2639-sec-0230"><label>6</label><title>CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION</title><p>In this review, we provide an overview of the current progress in gene editing tool development and summarize their application in various scenarios based on users&#8217; needs. The challenges and limitations of existing gene editing therapies are also discussed, along with a summary of the ongoing research and clinical trials for CVD. Bases are the fundamental components of carbon&#8208;based life. The ability of the gene editing tools to locate, cut, and modify these bases has proven beneficial in enhancing our well&#8208;being and preventing diseases. In the field of cardiovascular medicine, CRISPR/Cas&#8208;mediated research has shown promising results in vivo gene therapy, as shown in Figure&#160;<xref rid="mco2639-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Numerous therapeutic targets have been screened and confirmed to be effective.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="mco2639-fig-0002" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>The application of the CRISPR/Cas system for gene editing therapy in CVD.

The combination of the gene editing system with the AAV delivery system has shown significant advancements in the field of CVD. Furthermore, the use of lipid nanoparticles as a delivery method shows great promise. Gene editing therapy offers a sustainable solution for patients, reducing their dependence on ongoing medication. Additionally, it holds promise for individuals with genetic diseases to pursue alternative lifestyles.</p><p>However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential risks associated with gene therapy. A study has indicated that gene therapy for Hemophilia type A may increase the risk of liver cancer in a specific group of patients over a prolonged treatment period.<xref rid="mco2639-bib-0256" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>256</sup>
</xref> This has led us to recognize that potential effects on patients that are long term and/or not easily observable after gene therapy are equally worthy of attention. It is important to emphasize that finding a complete cure for these diseases is a complex task that requires meticulous attention to various details, such as effectiveness, durability, and most importantly, safety in terms of avoiding risks like hepatotoxicity, cancer, and immunity concerns, among others. The gene editing system serves as a valuable tool for exploring new possibilities and turning them into reality. There are still unexplored territories that lie between current achievements and the ethical boundaries that must be cautiously navigated. Therefore, the responsible use of gene editing technology is essential for safeguarding and optimizing our lives.</p></sec><sec id="mco2639-sec-0240"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>Xinyu Wu searched the literature and drafted the manuscript.
