Introduction</title><p>Nanochemistry is an emerging research field in the border of chemistry and nanoscience that involves a cross-disciplinary convergence of physical, biological, material sciences, and engineering for multiple purposes [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For example, nanochemistry-based nano-bioplatforms exploit natural biomimetic systems that connect chemical and biological systems with nanotechnology and study how such converging technologies help to achieve a better understanding of phenomena at the nanoscale [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. With the advent of these emerging research fields, it has been possible to rapidly advance nanobioconjugate architectures with potential in a myriad of cross-disciplinary practical applications [<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The development of nano-bio-constructs involves several chemical modifications on nanometer scaled structures, of which the properties are size, shape, self-assembly and defects dependent, while features are explained and well-studied in the fields of nanobiotechnology and nanochemistry.</p><p>Over the past years, nanobioconjugates have been probed as drug delivery systems, imaging and contrast agents, theranostic platforms, and for purification and concentration of biomolecules. They have received considerable attention in biosensing systems as amplifiers of the resultant signal. Nanobioconjugates are hybrid nano(bio)materials that result from the integration among nanomaterials (NMs) and biomolecules [<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The development of these hybrid systems aims to get new materials with improved properties concerning each of their components acting alone [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Each component contributes to the hybrid with a unique property or function that is missing in the other one. Nanobioconjugates are having a significant impact on the development of theranostic (therapeutic and diagnostic) tools in the biomedicine field [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and have particular potential to revolutionize diagnostic approaches. Limitations of the nanobioconjugates are related to the uncontrolled number of affinity biomolecules that can be linked to the nanostructure, which leads to a variety of unwished phenomena [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For instance, a large number of biomolecules linked to nanostructures leads to hindered biochemical activity, alteration of the targeting and biomolecule properties and receptor cross-link [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Conversely, undesirable multivalent interactions and associated cooperative binding become insignificant if nanostructures have a proper number of linked biomolecules [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Within the nanobioconjugates development process, there are some features of the nanomaterials synthesis and the biomolecules coupling that must be controlled to reach stable hybrid materials. The nature of the precursors, their interactions and reagents ratio, the use of surfactants, temperature, time and stirring conditions, among other parameters of the synthesis process, impact on nanomaterial characteristics and their preferential crystal growth [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nanomaterials may present defects depending on the synthesis method, including non-uniform surfaces, edges, lattices, and vertices that serve as points for the enhanced catalysis and anchoring of biomolecules. Bioconjugation employs many nanochemistry-based approaches. For example, carboxylic groups from graphene oxide (GO) can bind covalently aminated biomolecules [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Different crystalline orientations of gold nanosurfaces chemisorb thiol groups naturally from proteins, peptides, DNA strands, and alkyl organic compounds to form self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), among many other examples of bioconjugation [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Figure 1A highlights eight different nanobioconjugate configurations [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the simplest format, the biomolecules might interact directly with the nanostructures (NSs). In more complex formats, the NSs surround or encapsulate the biological components of the nanobioconjugates. Target refers to the (bio)molecule of interest. Bioreceptors, also named ligands, are any kind of molecule that binds to a specific target commonly linked to the transducer, NS, or NM surfaces. Core and shell layers refer to the inner and outermost parts of NSs or NMs. The latter one is commonly bioconjugated with ligands when developing nanobioconjugates and assembling biosensors [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Figure 1B represents a NP decorated with diverse functional biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, drugs, peptides, antibodies, enzymes and others [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Choosing the bioconjugation strategy is important and depends not only on nanomaterial composition, structure, and available functional groups but on the type of biological molecule, its size, chemical composition, and the requirements of the final application. Figure 1C shows four general conjugation strategies to link biomolecules to NM surfaces [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Pre- and post-bioconjugation physicochemical metrics include NM size, morphology and aspect ratio, aggregation/agglomeration state, purity, chemical composition, surface characteristics, &#950; potential, surface area, and stability, as well as solubility, structure, orientation, and activity of the biomolecule [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In the following sections are described the nanobioconjugates assembly and characterization based on the use of different nanomaterials such as noble metals, oxide metals, polymers, carbon allotropes, quantum dots (QDs), and biomolecules that include proteins, antibodies, aptamers, carbohydrates, and single and double DNA/RNA strands, among others. Hereafter, the review illustrates the use of these nanobioconjugates for signal amplification of biorecognition events in a variety of biosensor formats focused on molecular-, enzymatic- and electroactive complex-based strategies. Finally, it points out the current challenges and future perspectives of nanobioconjugates for signal amplification in biosensing.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-molecules-25-03542"><title>2.

Biomolecules such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids (i.e., DNA/RNA, oligomers, aptamers, and ribozymes/DNAzymes), lipids, fatty acids, and carbohydrates link to the nanomaterials for developing plenty of nanobioconjugate configurations, depending on the aim or the application.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-25-03542"><title>2.1. Noble Metal Nanobioconjugates</title><p>Noble metals are characterized by their ability to resist corrosion and oxidation under exposure to oxidative conditions. Rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, osmium, indium, platinum, and gold are a select group of metals that are considered in the noble metal family [<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Nanomaterials of noble metals synthesized in the form of nanoparticles, nanorods, nanoshells, nanocages, and hollow nanospheres, have been bioconjugated for the development of electrochemical biosensing platforms [<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, Wahyuni et al. developed nanobioconjugates based on DNA and AuNPs to detect Sus scrofa mitochondrial DNA. The nanobioconjugation was achieved by attaching DNA probes onto an AuNPs surface, electroplated at an SPCE surface, through the 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) linker by the EDC/NHS coupling chemistry. The DNA from the nanobioconjugates hybridized with the complementary target sequence (Sus scrofa mitochondrial) to form a dsDNA. Methylene blue (MB) that interacts with guanine bases on ssDNA and intercalates with dsDNA was used as a signal indicative of the target detection. In the presence of mitochondrial Sus scrofa DNA, the dsDNA complex gave an amplified signal response with respect to the ssDNA one, thanks to the higher quantity of MB molecules that were intercalated in between the dsDNA. This genosensor was interrogated by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) at a potential window from &#8722;0.45 V to +0.1 V, reaching a linear range from 0.1 to 5.0 &#956;g/mL, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.58 &#956;g/mL [<xref rid="B24-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. </p><p>Shamsipur et al. reported the development of a biosensor based on aptamers (Apt) bioconjugated with a silver nanocluster (AgNCs) for the impedimetric detection of cytochrome c (Cyt c), a small hemeprotein that stimulates the apoptotic process into the cytoplasm. The Apt@AgNCs were employed for the detection of apoptosis based on the Cyt c release from the mitochondria in lysates from human embryonic kidney cells. Ag(I) ions from an AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution were employed for the nanobioconjugates synthesis, due to their high affinity to bind with oligonucleotide bases from the DNA aptamer. The as-developed Apt@AgNCs, chemisorbed onto a gold electrode (GE), served for the specific binding of Cyt c. The biosensor responded to changes in Cyt c concentrations in a linear range from 0.15 to 375 nM, with a LOD of 72 pM [<xref rid="B25-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], when interrogated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).</p><p>Zhao et al. designed a biosensor that used a platinum and palladium nanocage (Pt@PdNCs) hybrid material to develop two DNA-based nanobioconjugates for the sensitive detection of Pb<sup>2+</sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03542-f002">Figure 2</xref>I. Bimetallic nanocages were first prepared with K<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> as precursors of Pd and Pt, respectively. After such, the nanobioconjugation involved anchorage of DNA aminated sequences (S3 and S4 probes) and the adsorption of the electroactive toluidine blue. The biosensor assembly started with chemisorption of an aminated DNA hairpin (H1) on top of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with electroplated AuNPs. DNAzyme substrate strand (S1) and DNAzyme catalytic strand (S2) probes were then hybridized, forming a specific DNAzyme that was cleavaged in the presence of Pb<sup>2+</sup>. The resultant cleavage sequences (rS1) opened the H1 sequence, which was then displaced by the presence of a second hairpin H2 for n cycles. Then, the opened H2 probe hybridized first with the S3-Pt@PdNCs nanobioconjugate and this hybridized then with the S4-Pt@PdNCs one to form a network. Finally, (4-<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-methylpyridiniumyl)-porphyrin (MnTMPyP) intercalated in between the dsDNA served as an enzyme mimic for the final signal response. The biosensor response was interrogated by DPV, being linear in range from 0.1 pM to 200 nM, with a LOD of 0.033 pM [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Tao et al. assembled an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor based on AuNPs conjugated with doxorubicin (AuNPs@Dox) for the detection of microRNA, a small endogenous molecule involved in the regulation of gene expression in the life process. First, the AuNPs@Dox@S1 nanobioconjugates were synthesized by using citrate stabilized AuNPs densely functionalized with Dox and thiolated DNA probes (S1). A thiolated capture probe was immobilized onto a gold pretreated electrode surface modified with mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH). Then, the AuNPs@Dox@S1 nanobioconjugate was dropped onto the electrode surface to allow the hybridization between the capture probe and S1 from nanobioconjugates. The S1 from the nanobioconjugates, hybridized with the capture probe, was displaced by the addition of different concentrations of miRNA let-7 target. The reported biosensor response, measured by EIS, was linear from 1 pM to 10 nM, with a LOD of 0.17 pM. The AuNPs@Dox nanobioconjugates in the biosensing platform allowed the ultrasensitive electrochemical detection and signaling amplification of miRNA, offering advantages in terms of sensitivity as compared to the northern blot and microarray assays, i.e., cost-affordable equipment and a straightforward operation system as compared to real-time PCR (RT-PCR) [<xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Some nanobioconjugates have been assembled into electrochemical platforms to detect the human breast carcinoma Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 cells (MCF-7). For example, Yazdanparast et al. designed an aptamer electrochemical biosensor based on the use of silver nanoparticles biofunctionalized with mucin-1 (Muc-1) aptamer (Apt-AgNPs). Muc-1 was covalently linked to the carboxyl groups of glutathione-coated AgNPs by the carbodiimide coupling chemistry. The Muc-1 was also covalently immobilized at a GCE covered with poly(glutamic acid)-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). MUC-1 from both the nanobioconjugates and the electrode surface specifically recognized MCF-7 cells, which were quantified by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). At optimized conditions, the biosensor was tested with different cell concentrations, reaching a linear working range from 1.0 &#215; 10<sup>2</sup> to 1.0 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL, with a LOD of 25 cells/mL [<xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. </p><p>For the same purpose, Wang et al. developed a cytosensor based on the use of polyhedral AuPd alloy nanoparticles (PH-AuPd NPs) conjugated with a DNA aptamer as a signal tag and a three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (3D-rGO) as the transducer platform. The PH-AuPd NPs were prepared by using HAuCl<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> as Au and Pd precursors and ascorbic acid (AA) as a reducing agent in the presence of copper-(II), acetate (Cu(CH<sub>2</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>) and octadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (OTAC). PH-AuPd NPs were then functionalized with streptavidin followed by immobilization of a biotinylated DNA aptamer (H2) (H2/SA-PH-AuPd). The transducer was a GCE modified with 3D-rGO and AuNPs to immobilize a thiolated aptamer H1 that interacted specifically with the MCF-7 cells. Thus, MCF-7 cells were sandwiched in between the aptamer-modified transducer and the nanobioconjugate to complete the biosensing assay, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03542-f002">Figure 2</xref>II. At optimal conditions, the cytosensors was tested by DPV with different target concentrations responding in a linear range from 50 to 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL, with a LOD of 20 cells/mL [<xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Coming back to the detection of cancer biomarkers, Zhou et al. proposed an electrochemical immunosensor based on the use of the hydroxyl pillar[5]arene@AuNPs@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> hybrid nanomaterial bioconjugated with a secondary prostate-specific antigen (PSA) antibody (Ab2). The hybrid nanomaterial was synthesized by mixing a solution containing hydroxyl pillar[5]arene (HP5) with HAuCl<sub>4</sub> and further functionalized with graphitic carbon nitride (C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) mediated by the pyrolysis of thiourea. Then, the hybrid nanomaterial was mixed with a solution containing MB and further incubated in an Ab2 solution to obtain the final HP5@AuNPs@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-Ab2 nanobioconjugate. Otherwise, a primary antibody (Ab1) was adsorbed on top of AuNPs electroplated at the surface of a GCE. A solution containing the PSA was added to the electrode surface, followed by the nanobioconjugates. At optimal conditions, the immunosensor was tested by DPV with different PSA target concentrations, having a linear response in the range from 0.0005 to 10.00 ng/mL, with a LOD of 0.12 pg/mL, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03542-f002">Figure 2</xref>III [<xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, nanobioconjugates based on DNA sequences have been assembled to detect other cancer biomarkers. For instance, Mo et al. reported a DNA rolling photoelectrochemical biosensor for detecting oral cancer overexpressed 1 biomarker (ORAOV1) based on AuNPs bioconjugated with DNA sequences, for DNA rolling engineering. A thiolated DNA probe H1 was chemisorbed at the AuNPs surface (AuNPs-H1). The resultant nanobioconjugates started the catalytic hairpin assembly by using the DNA ORAOV1 target that opened the hairpin H1, and then, the target was displaced by the presence of the hairpin H2 getting the AuNPs-H1/H2 nanobioconjugate, which cycle was repeated several times. For the biosensor assembly, GO-modified GCE was decorated with hemin through &#960;-&#960; stacking interactions and PtNPs further electroplated to link DNA capture probes, which hybridized a fraction of H2 from the AuNP-H1/H2nanobioconjugate. Next, T7 exonuclease removed the nanobioconjugate-capture probe duplex, leaving a small fraction of the capture probe. The remaining fraction of the capture probe was incubated with an AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution in which Ag<sup>+</sup> ions interacted with high affinity with cytosine bases. Finally, the Ag<sup>+</sup> ions were electrochemically reduced to produce silver nanoclusters (NCs) that served as a signal amplification tag, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03542-f002">Figure 2</xref>IV. At optimized conditions, the developed biosensing platform was tested with different ORAOV1 concentrations. The platform was photo-stimulated to give a concentration-dependent photocurrent signal intensity in a linear range from 1 fM to 10 nM, with a LOD of 0.33 fM. The biosensor demonstrated the ability to test ORAOV1 in saliva samples with high sensitivity [<xref rid="B31-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In the context of cancer biomarkers detection, Miao et al. employed DNA nanobioconjugates for the detection of microRNA-21. The AuNPs-ssDNA nanobioconjugates were synthesized by chemisorbing a thiolated ssDNA detection probe functionalized with MB on top of AuNPs that served as signaling tag. The biosensor was assembled at a thiolated capture probe-modified GE as a transducer platform. The miRNA-21 target hybridized in between the capture and the detection probe. A solution containing K<sup>+</sup> ions and iridium (III) complex was added to the sandwich-type genosensor that led to the formation of G-quadruplex that catalyzed the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) with MB as a mediator.

Brownian motion allows for the estimation of their diffusion coefficient, which is directly correlated with the hydrodynamic radius by the Stoke&#8211;Einstein equation.

In the absence of PNK, the DNA probe keep unaltered at the electrode surface, thus retaining several ruthenium molecules for the electrochemical signal response. The biosensor was evaluated by DPV, which response was PNK concentration-dependent in a linear range from 0.001 to 10 U/mL, with a LOD of 7.762 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> U/mL [<xref rid="B141-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>].</p><p>Some authors have employed dyes as an alternative to the use of electroactive ruthenium complexes to amplify the signal response of electrochemical biosensors. For this purpose, Miao et al. assembled an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor based on AuNPs functionalized with ssDNA and assisted by MB as signaling reporter, for the specific detection of the tyrosine kinase-7 protein, a cancer biomarker-associated cell membrane protein, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03542-f006">Figure 6</xref>V. AuNPs were synthesized by a reduction method followed by immobilization of thiolated DNA probes. The biosensing platform was a thiolated aptamer linked to a GCE previously functionalized with Nafion and decorated with AuNPs through electrostatic interactions. In the absence of the target, a helper probe hybridized in between the aptamer and DNA from the nanobioconjugates. MB was then intercalated in between the dsDNA producing a signal response. In the absence of the target, the aptamer changed conformation as a result of the aptamer-target protein interaction. Such conformation change prevented the nanobioconjugate to be linked to the platform and the concomitant MB intercalation. Then, the signal response tested by DPV was dependent on target concentration, which was inversely proportional but linear from 1 pm to 100 pM and from 100 pM to 1 nM, with a LOD of 372 fM [<xref rid="B142-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>].</p><p>Liu et al. illustrated the development of a nanobioconjugate-based enzyme-free electrochemical biosensor consisting of an AuNP-coated Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub> hybrid material decorated with DNA sequences for the detection of microRNA-21, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03542-f006">Figure 6</xref>VI. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs were obtained by a hydrothermal method, further coated with AuNPs and functionalized with a thiolated DNA sequence (S1) to obtain the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub>@Au-S1 nanobioconjugate. A hairpin H1 was attached to an AuNP-coated GCE to link the target sequences that were then displaced by a H2, which process was repeated n times. The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub>@Au-S1 nanobioconjugate was then added to hybridize with a portion of the H1 to complete the biosensing assay. Finally, MB dye intercalated in between the dsDNA, thus producing a signal by DPV that was correlated to the target concentration. The biosensor response was linear, ranging from 1 fM to 1 nM, with a LOD of 0.33 fM [<xref rid="B143-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>].</p><p>Lin et al. developed an immunosensor for the detection of GP73, a protein that plays a key role in the sorting and modification of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. The immunosensor was based on a biotinylated DNA tetrahedron as an immobilization probe for anchoring a primary antibody through the biotin-streptavidin interaction. The antibody was specific for the antigen Golgi protein 73, which at the same time bound with a secondary antibody covalently modified with Ru<sup>3+</sup> complex. MB intercalated in between the dsDNA from the tetrahedron, thus giving an internal reference signal. The Ru<sup>3+</sup> covalently coupled to the secondary antibody was responsible for the current signal response. The immunosensor response was linear, ranging from 15 pg/mL to 0.7 ng/mL, with a LOD of 15 pg/mL. The device was able to detect the antigen present in real samples [<xref rid="B144-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>].</p><p>The above section illustrated the development of different nanobioconjugates as signaling tags for the enhanced signal amplification in a variety of biosensing platforms. These nanobioconjugates based on nanomaterials have been assembled to increase the signal response of biorecognition events. Most of the reported electrochemical biosensors that use nanobioconjugates to increase the signal response are a proof-of-concept for testing target biomolecules associated with pathogens and other biomedical and environmental applications that include the detection of heavy metals among other uses. However, some other reports go a step further towards testing real samples, thus demonstrating the capabilities of signal amplification response of the proposed biosensors and their enormous potential for sensing in real scenarios. Overall, nanobioconjugates, as components of electrochemical biosensing platforms, have demonstrated their potential to be used in the development of a routine assay for a variety of target analytes. <xref rid="molecules-25-03542-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> summarizes selected illustrative research works in which nanobioconjugates were assembled in electrochemical biosensing platforms for the improved signal amplification of biorecognition events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5-molecules-25-03542"><title>5. Current Challenges and Future Perspectives in Nanobioconjugates Development</title><p>We have reviewed several biosensing reports that include nanobioconjugates for signal amplification in multiple formats. They have outstanding performance and the potential to achieve high sensitivity and ultralow limits of detection in nanobioconjugate-based assays. Their features are compatible with multiplexing and miniaturization, as well as portability and low volume of samples and reagents. However, there are still some challenges to face before implementing such reporters in biosensors in a real scenario. For example, biomarkers are commonly present in biological fluids in extremely low concentrations [<xref rid="B145-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>], so their detection and monitoring require highly sensitive devices.</p><p>The use of nanostructured materials in the development of electrochemical biosensing platforms offers the opportunity of a wide range of modifications with different bioreceptors and thus specific detection of a myriad of target biomolecules. All parameters involved in the nanobioconjugates development need to be systematically optimized and standardized before being incorporated in electrochemical biosensing platforms for the detection of the target molecules with high sensitivity and specificity. In this context, nanobioconjugates stability must be well established to ensure nanobioconjugates performance and reproducibility of biosensors. Parameters influencing the long term stability of nanobioconjugates such as nanomaterial geometric shape [<xref rid="B146-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], ionic strength [<xref rid="B147-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>], pH [<xref rid="B148-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>], and temperature [<xref rid="B149-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>] need to be optimized. The need to strictly control the number of affinity biomolecules in a nanobioconjugate to avoid unwished phenomena is still a challenge. An excessive number of biomolecules linked onto nanostructured surfaces may hinder their biochemical activity, which alters their targeting ability by cross-linking with other molecules [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Conversely, multivalent interactions and associated cooperative binding become insignificant whether nanostructures have a lower number of biomolecules attached to them [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Yet, nanobioconjugates have tremendous potential for the development of biosensing platforms and devices of superior performance, with an excellent capacity for enhancing the signal amplification processes of biorecognition events. They have many advantages as compared with conventional assays. Although conventional assays are ordinarily used, many of them are time-consuming and require robust instrumentation, which hinders timely and accurate target detection and quantification [<xref rid="B150-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Advantages of nanobioconjugate-based assays include their relatively lower cost and faster analysis time, and the fact that they do not require expensive equipment and there is no need for well-trained personal. The aforementioned features make such nanoplatforms hold the potential to be implemented for analysis in place, even in remote settings.</p><p>Two-dimensional nanomaterials are emerging nanomaterials of enhanced physical, chemical and optical properties as compared to their bulk counterparts [<xref rid="B151-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>], which make them promising for the development of nanobioconjugates. For instance, their high surface area allows for hosting thousands of biomolecules in a proper nano-environment that promotes the stability and activity of biomolecules [<xref rid="B151-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>,<xref rid="B152-molecules-25-03542" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Implementation of 2D nanomaterials in nanobioconjugate assemblies opens opportunities towards keep increasing sensitivity and stability and decreasing the LOD of bioassays where they are assembled.</p><p>Overall, nanobioconjugates offer the possibility to detect different target biomolecules with high specificity and sensitivity in less time and in a straighter forward way as compared with standard assay methods. Such unique features, along with versatility, accurate quantification, and amenability for multiplexing and miniaturization, are paving the way towards the development of new enhanced nanobioconjugate-based device alternatives. Progress remains to be made for positioning this technology in the market. It requires joined efforts from cross-disciplinary fields that involve nanochemistry and nanobiotechnology. However, it is clear that nanobioconjugates are at the forefront of research in many fields, not only as reporters in signal amplification in biosensors, but as nanocarrires for targeted drug delivery and contrast agents in biomedical imaging among many others, always searching for novel and new opportunities depending on the final application.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-molecules-25-03542"><title>6. Concluding Remarks</title><p>This review illustrated a variety of strategies for assembling and characterizing nanobioconjugates based on the conjugation of nanomaterials with biomolecules.
