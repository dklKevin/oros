In Ghana, implants are available across the country and are the most commonly used contraceptive method among married women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From October 2017 and January 2018, we conducted a phone survey with a stratified random sample of 1,159 women who had obtained an implant from a public-sector Ghana Health Service clinic in 2 regions and 1,073 women who had an implant inserted through Marie Stopes International Ghana (MSIG) mobile outreach in 2 other regions.

Nearly half of public sector clients and one-third of outreach clients reported that their provider only told them of removal access at the place of insertion. Among women obtaining their implant in the public and outreach sectors, respectively, 32% and 21% reported ever wanting it removed and 61% and 55% who attempted removal obtained a removal on the first attempt. An additional 17% in each context were successful in having their implant removed within 1 week of the first attempt. Most women obtained removal from the same place they received their insertion (81% public, 70% outreach). Most women reported their overall removal experience was very or somewhat easy (74% public, 68% outreach). Challenges included cost, provider availability, interactions with providers, and difficult removals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Access to implant removal is not universal in Ghana.

Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, are rapidly scaling up implant provision. Since the implementation of the Implant Access Program in 2013, which reduced the price of these implants by half, 53 million implants have been purchased for low-resource countries.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In several countries, including Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, and Ghana, implants now make up one-quarter to one-half of all modern method use.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>Millions of implants are being inserted, but the extent to which providers and programs are prepared to handle the inevitable increase in demand for implant removal services is less clear. Ensuring access to quality implant removal services at term (labeled duration) or at any other time of a woman&#8217;s choosing is key for the long-term success of contraceptive implant programs and, even more importantly, compliance with principles of voluntarism and informed choice in contraceptive adoption and use.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Past experience with Norplant in the United States, as well as in low-income countries, demonstrated that lack of access to implant removal services or even the perception of insufficient access can be detrimental to the reputation of the method and raise serious concerns about freedom in contraceptive use.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Anecdotal information from a variety of contexts, as well as some survey data,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>&#8211;</sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> points to potential weaknesses in service delivery programs related to implant removal including inadequate medical equipment, insufficient numbers of trained providers, excessive fees required for removal or provider bias against removal before the product&#8217;s labeled duration of use. At present, however, systematic data on the accuracy or prevalence of these potential barriers are lacking.</p><p>At the global level, recognition of the need for focused attention on implant removal resulted in the creation of the Implant Removal Task Force in 2015.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Although the task force has been instrumental for identifying research and programming gaps, a dearth of data on the state of removal services, especially from users&#8217; perspectives, remains.</p><p>We designed this study to generate evidence on the state of access to removal services for women receiving implants in Ghana and to identify areas for improvement that could inform programs globally. We chose Ghana for this study because it is one of the top implant procuring countries in the world<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and had unique programmatic data in the form of electronic medical records, which allowed for identification and sampling of implant acceptors. To provide a comprehensive picture of the current situation in Ghana, we examined 2 important service delivery contexts for implants: public sector provision through static facilities and mobile outreach services. Both the Ghana Health Service (GHS) and Marie Stopes International/Ghana (MSIG), as well as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Ghana health team, have identified access to implant removal as an important element of family planning program strengthening.</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><p>We designed this study to generate evidence on the state of access to implant removal services in Ghana and to identify areas for improvement that could inform programs globally.</p></boxed-text><p>The modern contraceptive prevalence rate among married users in Ghana has nearly doubled in the past few years from 18.4% in 2013 to 30.7% in 2017 with implants making up 2.9% and 8.4%, respectively, of the modern contraceptive prevalence rate.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In 2013, 15.7% of married users were using implants<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and by 2017, this had increased to more than 30%,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> making implants the most commonly used method in the country. Implant use is also common among unmarried women with 17.8% of contraceptive users reporting implant use in the most recent survey.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Use is widespread across the country, and in the last 5 years, Ghana has procured more than 1.3 million implants.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In 2013, as part of a government effort to expand access to contraceptive implants, GHS revised its policy on implant provision, allowing community health nurses to insert and remove contraceptive implants.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> In addition, access to contraceptive implants has been promoted through the outreach services of private organizations such as MSIG, which has provided implants in its mobile outreach services at GHS facilities in Central and Western regions since 2011. Implants are an affordable long-acting and reversible method in Ghana offered to women for 2 Ghana cedis (42 US cents) in the public sector (inclusive of removal) and free of charge through MSIG outreach.</p><p>Our study had 4 objectives: (1) to measure implant acceptors&#8217; knowledge of the possibility of removal before labeled duration of use and when and where to obtain removal; (2) to describe reasons for seeking removal; (3) to estimate the proportion of implant acceptors who were able to get their implant removed; and (4) to document barriers to removal. The study was implemented by FHI 360 in collaboration with the Population Council of Ghana, MSIG, and GHS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Study Design</title><p>We conducted a mixed-methods study using a retrospective design to examine the removal desires and experiences of women who had received an implant, as well as the experiences of family planning providers. To capture dynamics surrounding access to implant removal services in different service delivery contexts while also ensuring some geographic and sociocultural diversity, we conducted the study in 2 regions with public sector service delivery through GHS facilities (Ashanti and Eastern regions) and 2 regions with MSIG mobile outreach services (Central and Western regions). The study was not designed to support comparison between the 2 service delivery contexts, but rather to inform recommendations for potential strengthening of services on a larger scale to benefit a greater number of women. To reach large numbers of women and identify those who wanted to have their implant removed, we conducted a phone survey with implant acceptors and an in-person exit survey with women receiving implant removal services from mobile teams (outreach regions only). In addition, we conducted follow-up in-depth interviews (IDIs) with a subset of implant acceptors to obtain a more detailed understanding of the circumstances affecting women&#8217;s ability to obtain removals to determine concrete ways to improve access, and IDIs with providers to provide detailed insights into possible constraints on the service delivery side. More detailed methods and study results are available from the programmatic report published <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://toolkits.knowledgesuccess.org/sites/default/files/access-to-implant_removal-ghana-finrpt-20190119.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">online</ext-link>.</p><p>FHI 360&#8217;s Protection of Human Subjects Committee, the Ghana Health Service Ethical Review Committee, and the Marie Stopes International Ethical Review Committee approved this study. Phone survey participants provided oral consent and in-person exit survey and IDI participants provided written consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Study Populations and Sample</title><sec id="s2.2.1"><title>Phone Survey With Implant Acceptors</title><p>In the public sector, a mobile and web-based system known as the reproductive services log (rsLog) electronically captures family planning and reproductive health data from clinic registers. The rsLog has been in use since January 2015 and was operational in 95 GHS facilities in Ashanti and Eastern Regions (approximately 30% of the public sector facilities in the 2 regions) at the time the study was conducted. Similarly, MSIG implemented its electronic client information center database in 2014 that includes service delivery data from outreach and static clinic clients. We focused our sample on women included in these electronic records. Eligible women for the phone survey included those who: (1) had an implant inserted between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2016 at a GHS facility in public regions or between 1 July 2014 and 31 December 2016 through MSIG mobile teams in outreach regions, (2) were aged 18&#8211;49 years at the time of implant insertion, and (3) had phone information available in their records.</p><p>Our sampling approach aimed to complete a minimum of 384 interviews of women who had ever wanted a removal in each context (public and outreach). We computed our sample size to be able to estimate the proportion of implant acceptors who were able to get their implant removed at first attempt with 95% confidence and 5% precision. Sample size calculations also assumed a base estimate of 50% as there was no preliminary information about the indicator of interest and to be conservative for sample size purposes.</p><p>In public regions, we selected a random sample of women stratified by health facility from the rsLog. Given that phone access information was not readily available in the rsLog, we oversampled women from the rsLog, looked for phone information in their clinic records, and proceeded to call those with phones. In outreach regions, we attempted to recruit all women in the electronic client information center database who met study eligibility criteria as the target sample size was not expected to be met unless all women were recruited. Women in both settings were first contacted by phone by GHS facility or MSIG staff and asked whether they would be willing to be contacted by a researcher associated with the study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p>Study Sample of Women, Aged 18&#8211;49 Years Old, Who Had a Contraceptive Implant Inserted in Public and Outreach Regions, Ghana</p><p>Abbreviations: CLIC, Client Information Center; IDI, in-depth interview; RA, research assistant; rsLog, Reproductive Services Log.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="GH-GHSP200020F001.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2.2.2"><title>Exit Interview With Women Receiving an Implant Removal</title><p>For practical reasons related to the longer duration of the program and preliminary information on the volume of clients seeking removal services, exit interviews were only implemented in the outreach context. We interviewed a convenience sample of women aged 18&#8211;49 years obtaining removal services from MSIG mobile teams to obtain information from women who had used an implant for longer periods. Trained research assistants were deployed at mobile outreach sites on discrete days and recruited women as they exited. Specific outings were selected based on convenience according to scheduled activities. MSIG providers asked all eligible women whether they would be willing to participate in the survey and study staff interviewed women in a private location after removal. Data collection was conducted during outreach outings until an overall target of 50 interviews were complete. The sample size was determined by budget and logistic considerations.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2.3"><title>IDIs with Implant Acceptors</title><p>We conducted IDIs with a subset of women (n=20) who participated in the phone survey and provided permission to be contacted again. IDIs were conducted in 1 public (Eastern Region) and 1 outreach region (Central Region) only for practical considerations. The participants represented 4 different profiles: (1) women who obtained removal at first attempt, (2) women who obtained removal on second or subsequent attempt (referred to as &#8220;delayed success&#8221;), (3) women who made at least 1 removal attempt but had not yet obtained removal by the time of the study, and (4) women who reported wanting removal but had not yet tried to access removal services. Sample size targets were set to achieve a minimum of 4 IDIs per target profile, influenced by a combination of time and budget constraints and general acceptance that 4&#8211;5 IDIs are sufficient to identify the most important themes of a study. Recent evidence indicates that 80% saturation can be reached within 8 IDIs; we aimed for 8 IDIs for the main group of women with delayed removals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s2.2.4"><title>IDIs With Family Planning Providers</title><p>We also conducted IDIs with a convenience sample of family planning providers (n=15) who conduct implant insertions and removals at GHS facilities in public regions (GHS providers) and at GHS facilities partnering with MSIG in outreach regions (GHS and MSIG providers) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Data Collection and Analysis</title><sec id="s2.3.5"><title>Phone and Exit Survey</title><p>Trained data collectors conducted phone and in-person exit interviews between October 2017 and January 2018 in either English, Twi, or Fante, according to the participant&#8217;s preference. Respondents to the phone survey were compensated 5 Ghana cedis (approximately US$1) in mobile money pushed to their device; and exit interview respondents were provided the same amount in cash at the time of the interview. At the time of the interview, data collectors entered data into tablets containing an Open Data Kit survey program. Data were transferred from the tablets to a secure server immediately using a cellular network or wireless connection. Data were then deleted from the tablets to ensure participant confidentiality. Data collection forms were programmed with automatic constraints to minimize human error. Data collector supervisors performed spot quality checks on the data and an analyst at FHI 360 in North Carolina conducted additional quality checks.</p><p>We analyzed data by study objective separately for each study context (public and outreach). For women who attempted removal, we classified removal by timing of attempt: first attempt, within 1 week of first attempt, longer than 1 week after first attempt, and attempted but not yet removed. We further divided unsuccessful removal attempts by stated desire to keep or remove the implant in the future.</p><p>We calculated sampling weights for the public sector sample as the inverse of the probability of selection of implant clients for the phone interviews. Weights were calculated based on the number of implant insertions among women of eligible age during the study eligibility period at each facility as per the rsLog and the total number of interviews completed per facility. All analyses (e.g., percentages, means, standard deviations, and ranges) were weighted; however, we present unweighted frequencies to clearly indicate the available sample size. Results are presented descriptively except for the indicators associated with seeking removal, for which we provide 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the public region data. The relative wealth of all implant acceptor study participants was calculated using a subset of variables from the USAID Poverty Assessment Tool,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> though as all variables from the tool were not included in the survey, we were unable to categorize respondents as below or above the poverty line in Ghana, as is the intent of the tool. Rather, we used principal components analysis to create a score representing a relative measure of wealth within the sample. We used STATA version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) for all analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3.6"><title>IDIs</title><p>Two trained qualitative interviewers conducted the IDIs with women in the language of their preference (English, Twi, or Fante) and providers in English between November 2017 and July 2018 using topic guides. The interviewers audiorecorded all interviews and transcribed them into English. The study team developed codebooks, which included both inductive and deductive codes. Two team members coded the transcripts using NVivo 11 (QSR International, Burlington, MA) and incorporated periodic intercoder reliability checks of 15% of transcripts to ensure coding consistency. The team developed detailed thematic memos to identify key dimensions of each code and synthesize data. Women who participated in IDIs were compensated 5 Ghana cedis (approximately US$1) for their time and reimbursed for travel expenses to the interview site. Providers did not receive compensation for participating in the study as the interviews occurred at their workplace during regular work hours.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Phone Survey Results</title><sec id="s3.1.1"><title>Study Population and Participant Characteristics</title><p>In the public context, 1,159 women participated in the survey, representing a 78.3% response rate of women who agreed to be contacted by a study research assistant.

In the outreach sector, more social influence (51.5%) was reported among women who wanted a removal versus women who did not want a removal (29.8%) with the most commonly mentioned influence being a neighbor or friend (<xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3.1.4"><title>Experience Seeking Removal</title><p>The majority of women in the public sector who reported ever wanting a removal also sought removal (91.9% [95% CI=86.7, 95.1]) (data not shown). Of these, 61.1% (95% CI=54.8, 67.1) obtained a removal at their first attempt and an additional 16.5% (95% CI=12.2, 21.9) obtained a removal within 1 week of first attempt. At the time of the survey, 8.1% (95% CI=5.1, 13.6) of women wanting a removal had not yet had their implant removed despite attempting at least 1 time. Of these women, 4.0% (95% CI=2.3, 6.9) decided that they still desired to remove the implant, 2.2% (95% CI=0.5, 9.8) were unsure if they still desired to remove the implant, and 1.8% (95% CI=0.9, 3.7) decided that they no longer desired to remove the implant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p>Outcomes Among Women Who Attempted to Have Contraceptive Implants Removed in Public and Outreach Regions, Ghana</p><p><sup>a</sup>Percentages are adjusted for sampling weights.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="GH-GHSP200020F002.jpg"/></fig><p>In the outreach sector, 57.1% of women who reported ever wanting a removal attempted to have their implant removed (data not shown) and just over half of these women (54.6%) obtained removal on their first attempt.

Of the women who wanted a removal but never attempted removal, the top stated reasons were changing their mind (37.5%), too expensive (16.7%), and being too busy (10.4%) (data not shown).

Just over 10.0% in both contexts reported that there was a time that the provider would not remove their implant though the woman wanted a removal. In the outreach context, 13.5% said that the provider could not palpate their implant and, thus, could not remove. Women also reported complications they experienced with implant removal.

About half of the providers felt it was appropriate to do an early removal if a client wished to conceive. However, a few in the outreach context said they decided whether or not a client was &#8220;ready&#8221; to have another child before removing the implant.

Many felt that the frequency with which they encountered difficult removals was due to poor insertion by other providers, including implants being inserted into muscles or the wrong part of the body. Nearly half of providers said they had done removals that were painful for the client, and some providers noted that these painful removals could discourage implant use in communities. More than half of the 15 providers reported ever having made a referral to a different facility or seeking assistance from other facility staff for difficult removals.

It is important to note that our measure of &#8220;success&#8221; in accessing removal is crude and does not capture experiences where women may have received counseling that led them to decide to keep their implant. Future research should take into account satisfaction with such provider interactions.</p><p>Removal knowledge and access were not universal, however, and many women reported having only been told that they could have their implant removed where they had received it. We also found that more than half of women who had obtained an implant from an MSIG outreach provider and said they wanted a removal did not actually attempt to have their implant removed. Some of these women reported that they changed their mind about wanting their implant removed, and others indicated that cost and the need to travel to a facility presented barriers.</p><p>In addition to describing access to removal services, this study also provides some insight into why implant users seek removal before expiration. Our survey results indicate that side effects, including menstrual bleeding changes, were the predominant reason for desiring early removal. However, the qualitative findings provided a more complete picture, showing that the decision to remove &#8220;early&#8221; was often multifaceted. Either a combination of different kinds of side effects or side effects coupled with social pressure, particularly husband/partner pressure to remove, would motivate women to seek early removal. Some women reported that their partners were concerned about the side effects that they were experiencing, and others described being forced to remove their implant by their partner.</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><p>This study also provides insight into why implant users seek removal before expiration.</p></boxed-text><p>Implant users&#8217; experience and reporting of side effects appears to also influence their removal experience and explain why they do not always obtain removal on first attempt. Several women described being encouraged by their provider to keep their implant with counseling and side effect treatment. This provider reassurance is important for allaying health concerns associated with implant use and managing unwanted side effects. However, some women made subsequent attempts at removal. Our qualitative results suggest that removal to become pregnant or because a partner or husband demands removal appears to more likely to result in removal than complaints of side effects. Several providers said they would perform removal on request and that they believed that removal should be at the sole discretion of the woman using the implant. Some other providers and users noted that removal often also depended on provider judgment.</p><p>Although most women who had obtained an implant removal described their experience as easy, our qualitative findings indicate that difficult removals, including nonpalpable and bent/broken rods, occurred with some frequency. We cannot estimate prevalence of difficult removals from these data, but several women and most providers said that they had experienced a difficult removal. More research should explore the extent, causes, and consequences of difficult removals in this setting and elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, our data indicate that the financial cost of implant removal is uneven and can, in some cases, constrain access. Women seeking removal reported paying a range of fees despite the fact that GHS has a documented fee for removal of 2 Ghana cedis (approximately 40 US cents) and MSIG outreach has no fee. Both women and providers described that fees may differ based on the facility, the length of time a woman has had her implant, or the reasons for the removal. Such uneven charges for removal present a clear challenge to free and informed choice for contraceptive use.</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><p>Data indicate that the financial cost of implant removal is uneven and can sometimes constrain access.</p></boxed-text><p>GHS is committed to improving access to quality FP services to all Ghanaians and has prioritized the utilization of these study results to improve implant service provision. USAID Ghana is working with GHS to identify and implement interventions to improve the quality of implant service delivery and to ensure women have access to removal services for any reason and at no cost. Research findings have been disseminated throughout Ghana in a series of events culminating in a national steering committee meeting to synthesize recommendations. A technical working group convened to revise and update the national implant training materials, and a select group of national and regional FP trainers have now been trained on the updated materials.</p><sec id="s4.1"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has several limitations. First, although the rsLog and client information center electronic databases provided a unique opportunity to identify and contact a large sample of implant users, the systems are both relatively new and the data they contained were not complete. In addition to incomplete or incorrect phone information, inherent challenges with a phone survey included phones being turned off, running out of battery, poor reception, numbers changing frequently, or respondents not answering calls.</p><p>We were also limited by how long the electronic systems had been in place. Most women recruited from the systems had had their implant for less than 18 months, so their experiences may be different from women who have had their implant for a longer amount of time. While the exit interviews provide perspectives from a few longer-term users, the limited sample makes drawing comparisons across groups difficult.</p><p>Finally, the eligibility criterion that women have phone information available in their record carries some risk of selection bias and likely may have excluded the poorest women. The experiences of some women who may have experienced challenges accessing removal services may have been missed or underrepresented.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study provides some reassuring data that most women who desire to remove their implant are able to receive a removal in a timely fashion. However, the results also indicate that not all women are able to access removal when and where they want and room for program improvement exists both in the public sector and for mobile outreach services.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank the study participants for sharing their time and experiences with us.
