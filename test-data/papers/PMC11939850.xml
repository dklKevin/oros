CRISPR/Cas systems have emerged as transformative tools in biosensing due to their unparalleled specificity, programmability, and unique enzymatic activities. They exhibit two key cleavage behaviors: precise ON-target cleavage guided by specific protospacers, which ensures accurate target recognition, and bystander cleavage activity triggered upon target binding, which enables robust signal amplification. These properties make CRISPR/Cas systems highly versatile for designing biosensors for ultra-sensitive detection. This review comprehensively explores recent advancements in CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors, highlighting their impact on improving biosensing performance. We discuss the integration of CRISPR/Cas systems with diverse signal readout mechanisms, including electrochemical, fluorescent, colorimetric, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and so on. Additionally, we examine the development of integrated biosensing systems, such as microfluidic devices and portable biosensors, which leverage CRISPR/Cas technology for point-of-care testing (POCT) and high-throughput analysis. Furthermore, we identify unresolved challenges, aiming to inspire innovative solutions and accelerate the translation of these technologies into practical applications for diagnostics, food, and environment safety.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CRISPR/Cas system</kwd><kwd>biosensors</kwd><kwd>biosensing systems</kwd><kwd>diagnostics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Key Research and Development Program of China</funding-source><award-id>2023YFB3208200</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>21974147</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2023YFB3208200) and the National Natural Science foundation of China (21974147).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-biosensors-15-00155"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Biosensors are analytical detection systems that convert biological recognition events into useful information. Typical biosensors primarily consist of a biomolecular recognition unit that generates a selective response, a transducer unit that converts the biological recognition information into a digital detection signal, and an output unit responsible for signal amplification and display [<xref rid="B1-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Biosensors are widely used in various fields such as life and health sciences, food safety, and environmental protection.

These factors heavily influence the accuracy and effectiveness of subsequent treatment. High sensitivity and specificity in detection also reduce the possible results of false positives and negatives. In order to enable early intervention in adverse conditions such as diseases and pollution, there is an increasing demand for faster sensing methods. Therefore, new technical means must be employed for developing novel biosensors to meet the growing demand to overcome existing limitations (insufficient sensitivity, lack of specificity, high costs, etc.).</p><p>The CRISPR/Cas system plays a significant role in the immune processes of bacteria and archaea. Since it has been discovered in the 1980s, its unique properties (such as specificity, programmability, and accessibility) have attracted extensive attention [<xref rid="B7-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In 2012, Emmanuelle and Jennifer first utilized it as a novel tool for gene editing [<xref rid="B10-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Their contributions to this field were recognized with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry award in 2020 [<xref rid="B11-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The specific recognition ability of the CRISPR/Cas system for target nucleic acids and its cleavage activity also show great potential in biosensing. It has been successfully extended beyond nucleic acid detection to encompass other non-nucleic acid targets through innovative engineering approaches that integrate intermediate recognition elements and sophisticated signal transduction mechanisms. Owing to their good selectivity and sensitivity [<xref rid="B12-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors have played important roles in medical diagnoses [<xref rid="B13-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and environmental and healthy monitoring [<xref rid="B17-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], etc.</p><p>This review introduces the different kinds of CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors developed, discussing their research progress and working mechanisms.

Furthermore, our review focuses on less-explored CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors and their integration with emerging technologies that are shaping the future of biosensing. This review will primarily focus on the technical applications of CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors, and therefore, the introduction to the fundamental aspects of CRISPR/Cas systems will be relatively concise.

CRISPR/Cas System</title><p>The CRISPR/Cas system mainly consists of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and proteins. CRISPR, i.e., Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a special nucleic acid sequence found in bacteria and archaea, used to recognize specific nucleic acid sequences [<xref rid="B8-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) have enzymatic properties and enable the cleaving of nucleic acid sequences [<xref rid="B21-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. According to the updated classification by Kira Makarova et al. in 2020, the CRISPR/Cas system is divided into two Classes, which are further categorized into 6 types and 33 subtypes. Class 1 (including Type I, Type III, and Type IV) works by relying on multiple effector proteins, while Class 2 only has a single effector protein for function and includes Type II, Type V, and Type VI [<xref rid="B23-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The CRISPR/Cas systems execute their biological function via a well-defined three-stage process: adaptation (spacer acquisition), expression, and interference (target cleavage) [<xref rid="B24-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The targeting specificity, mediated by guide RNA complementarity, forms the molecular foundation for diverse biosensing applications. The presence and recognition of the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), located adjacent to the target sequence, serve as an essential prerequisite for the CRISPR/Cas system to initiate its nucleic acid cleavage activity. This PAM-dependent recognition mechanism not only ensures the precise targeting of specific DNA sequences but also contributes to the overall specificity and efficiency of CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors [<xref rid="B25-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The unique enzymatic activity of CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly the <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-cleavage activity of Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14 proteins, enables signal amplification essential for sensitive detection. <italic toggle="yes">Trans</italic>-cleavage refers to the nonspecific nuclease activity exhibited by Cas proteins following the recognition and binding of target sequences by the CRISPR/Cas system, which subsequently cleaves arbitrary single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules in the surrounding environment [<xref rid="B26-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The distinct cleavage characteristics, including both <italic toggle="yes">cis-</italic>cleavage (target-specific) and <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage (non-specific collateral) activities, fundamentally determine the biosensing performance and application scope of different CRISPR/Cas systems. CRISPR/Cas systems used for biosensing are primarily among Class 2, including CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cas12, CRISPR/Cas13, and CRISPR/Cas14, and their schematic representations are shown in <xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas9 belongs to Class 2, Type II. The full-length sgRNA as a functional component forms a stable complex with Cas9 that facilitates sequence-specific DNA recognition between the guide sequence and the target DNA, with the PAM sequence serving as an additional recognition element. Its target is double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). CRISPR/Cas9 uses the HNH structural domain to cleave the DNA strand complementary to crRNA and the RuvC structural domain to cleave the non-complementary DNA strand [<xref rid="B28-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>CRISPR/Cas12 belongs to Class 2, Type V. It includes various subtypes such as Cas12a (formerly known as Cpf1), Cas12b (formerly known as C2c1), and Cas12f (formerly known as Cas14a1). Cas12 utilizes sgRNA or crRNA for target recognition and recognizes complementary dsDNA through protospacer, while PAM as a functional motif allows for the re-orientation of the nuclease domains. Only when a PAM is available can ON-target cutting happen. Cas12 has a higher specificity for targeting dsDNA than ssDNA. Its <italic toggle="yes">cis-</italic>cleavage activity uses the RuvC domain, and the additional <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity can degrade nearby ssDNA indiscriminately [<xref rid="B29-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>CRISPR/Cas13 belongs to Class 2, Type VI, formerly known as C2c2. Guided by crRNA, its recognition of ssRNA is based mainly on the protospacer flanking site (PFS), rather than PAM sequences, and cleave targets by using two HEPN domains. Additionally, Cas13 also exhibits <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity, enabling it to indiscriminately degrade nearby ssRNA [<xref rid="B30-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>CRISPR/Cas14 belongs to Class 2, Type II, and represents the smallest known member of the CRISPR/Cas family in terms of molecular weight. Guided by sgRNA, Cas14 can recognize and cleave ssDNA independently of the PAM sequence and activate <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity to degrade nearby ssDNA indiscriminately. Meanwhile, Cas14 is sensitive to mismatch near the middle of the target, which inhibits its activity [<xref rid="B31-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3-biosensors-15-00155"><title>3. CRISPR/Cas System-Based Biosensors</title><p>CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors mainly consist of three core components: (1) CRISPR/Cas system for target recognition, (2) signal transduction elements, and (3) readout systems. Hitherto, a diverse range of biosensors have been developed by leveraging the specificity of both <italic toggle="yes">cis-</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activities of different CRISPR/Cas systems. Leveraging the inherent capability of CRISPR/Cas systems to recognize and cleave specific DNA sequences, biosensors can directly detect target DNA molecules. For non-nucleic acid targets, CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors incorporate auxiliary recognition elements such as aptamers and antibodies to achieve target-specific detection through indirect mechanisms. Cleavage-based detections measure target presence through the degradation of reporter molecules, while non-cleavage-based approaches primarily utilize target recognition events that trigger subsequent signal transduction pathways. These biosensors play important roles in many fields.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-biosensors-15-00155"><title>3.1.

CRISPR/Cas System-Based Electrochemical Biosensors</title><p>Electrochemical sensors offer advantages such as high sensitivity and selectivity, rapid response, low detection limits, and ease of on-site and real-time monitoring [<xref rid="B32-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; therefore, CRISPR/Cas System-based electrochemical biosensors are among the most common biosensors, utilizing the CRISPR/Cas system. These biosensors convert specific biological information into electrical signals such as current or impedance to reflect the detection results. They can detect not only pathogens like <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="B33-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella typhimurium</italic> [<xref rid="B34-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and the SARS-CoV-2 virus [<xref rid="B35-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which have extractable genetic information, but also substances closely related to human life, such as cardiac troponin I (cTn I), associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) [<xref rid="B36-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and even non-biological substances like cocaine [<xref rid="B37-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Pb<sup>2</sup>&#8314; [<xref rid="B38-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Our group and Ding&#8217;s group co-designed a CRISPR/Cas12a-driven electrochemical biosensor based on DNA framework nucleic acids (FNAs) (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A) [<xref rid="B39-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Gold nanoflowers (AuNFs) electrodeposited at the electrode interface are connected with FNAs through Au-S bonding. The DNA sequence, which is labeled with biotin, complementary to the HPV-16 single-strand target, is the extended sequence of FNAs. It can be used as a reporter probe. When the target HPV-16 sequence is present, Cas12a/crRNA duplexes recognize it, and the crRNA-target forms a complete R-loop with target-reporter DNA, activating the <italic toggle="yes">cis-</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleaving activities of Cas12a. The cleavage reporter probe cannot interact with the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP) conjugate that specifically binds on the electrode, and the catalytic reaction that occurs after adding hydrogen peroxide and TMB cannot produce a current response on the electrode. According to the degree of decline of the current signal, a quantitative detection of HPV-16 in the system with a wide dynamic range (100 fM to 100 pM) and a low detection limit (100 fM) is achieved. This biosensor is used with a home-made 16-channel electrochemical workstation, which can analyze multiple samples simultaneously, and it can also detect actual serum samples. This biosensor has good detection stability and universal potential. The uniqueness of this biosensor is that it uses FNAs to improve the accessibility of target and probe molecules while reducing the signal interference of non-specific adsorption on the electrode surface. Meanwhile, by combining the <italic toggle="yes">cis-</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activities of Cas12a, it greatly improves detection sensitivity and simplifies the experimental process effectively.</p><p>Xu et al. designed a CRISPR electrochemical biosensor and also utilized this strategy to achieve linear detection of the tumor marker miRNA-19b within a concentration range of 10 pM to 10<sup>4</sup> pM, with a detection limit of 10 pM [<xref rid="B40-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This biosensor, through the interaction of activated Cas13a <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage on the RNA reporter probe modified with avidin-HRP, which was immobilized on the DNA tetrahedral framework structure, and collection of the current signal decay using the electrochemical workstation was performed. Similarly, Cheng et al. developed a CRISPR electrochemical biosensor utilizing a DNA tetrahedron fixed on a gold electrode surface [<xref rid="B41-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This approach uses a special DNA tetrahedron that includes unique uracil base sequences. The electrochemically active molecule-methylene blue (MB) is stored within the DNA double helix structure. When the CRISPR/Cas13a system detects the target molecule bladder cancer biomarker circRNA, the activated Cas13a cleaves the uracil base sequences, causing the DNA tetrahedron to break apart. This results in the release of MB from the electrode surface, reducing the electrochemical peak current signal attributed to the redox of MB. The extent of the current signal decrease correlates with the concentration of circRNA in the urine sample.</p><fig position="anchor" id="biosensors-15-00155-f002" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Working principle of the FNAs-supported electrochemical biosensing platform in HPV-16 detection.

Based on the CRISPR/Cas12a system, it allows for sensitive detection of a programmed death-ligand 1 protein-positive (PD-L1<sup>+</sup>) exosome with a linear range of 1.2 &#215; 10<sup>2</sup> to 1.2 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup> particles/&#956;L and a detection limit of 38 particles/&#956;L. In this biosensor, the AuNPs grown in situ on the COF NSs enhance conductivity. They anchor the DNA activator probes and MB-PD aptamers, which are combined onto the electrode. When PD-L1<sup>+</sup> is present, the aptamer binds to PD-L1<sup>+</sup> and releases the activator probe.

As a result, the biological gate is closed, preventing the release of MB from the pores, leading to a weak current signal. Conversely, in the absence of the target molecule, ssDNA2 hybridizes with ssDNA1 to form dsDNA, which reduces the binding affinity, allowing the biological gate to open and produce a significant current signal.

A typical FET consists of a pair of source electrodes, drain electrode, and gate electrode. The FET channel connects the source electrode and drain electrode, allowing for current flow. While the voltage between the source&#8211;drain electrode remains constant, the magnitude of the current depends on the conductivity of the channel. This conductivity is adjusted by the external electric field provided by the gate electrode, which modulates the carrier density. This method of modulation is known as the field effect [<xref rid="B48-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

CRISPR/Cas System-Based Photoelectrochemical Biosensors</title><p>The advantages of photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensors lie in the ultra-high sensitivity, low background signal, sensing mode (focusing on the &#8220;signal-on&#8221; and &#8220;signal-off&#8221; modes), and the direction reversal of the photocurrent [<xref rid="B51-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This is mainly based on the unique properties of photoactive materials and P-N heterojunctions. As photoelectric transducers, photoactive materials are critical for signal transduction and readout. For example, quantum dots, at a specific quantum size, light absorption efficiency, and the electron transfer rate reach an equilibrium point, possessing the best photoelectrochemical performance. P-type and N-type semiconductors in P-N heterojunctions compete with each other to consume electron donors; therefore, N-type semiconductors can be used as a signal quencher to reduce the cathodic photocurrent of P-type semiconductor-modified electrodes [<xref rid="B52-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Li et al. designed a photoelectrochemical biosensor able to detect human papillomavirus HPV-16 in a wide range of 3.0 pM~600 nM with a detection limit of 1.0 pM [<xref rid="B53-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Researchers have attempted to investigate whether the flip and increase or decrease in photocurrent can be utilized to detect the target at the same time, and they have realized the detection of two kinds of targets by one biosensor.</p><p>Du et al. developed a multifunctional PEC biosensor for the detection of tumor markers-CEA and kanamycin (Kana) using the CRISPR/Cas system, quantum dots (QDs), and MOF (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C) [<xref rid="B43-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Cu-MOF was adsorbed on the electrodes by electrostatic interactions to generate cathodic photocurrents, and hairpin DNA (HP1) was immobilized on the Cu-MOF through amide bonds. The ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/ZnS QDs, which had particularly strong photoelectric signals, were selected as the signal molecules, and Au-Ag NPs were used as the carriers. They were modified with SP DNA and bbc DNA to form the SP-bbc DNA@QDs@Au-Ag signal probes. When the CEA specifically binds to its aptamer DNA and quantitatively releases cDNAs capable of hybridizing with HP1, the ssDNA formed after HP1-cDNA hybridization becomes partially complementary with the signal probe. It generates a polarity-flipped anodic photocurrent, the intensity of which correlates with the concentration of CEA. When Kana is added, the specific binding of Kana to its aptamer quantitatively releases activator DNA (acDNA), which activates Cas12a <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity, and the previously generated anodic photocurrent signal is significantly reduced. The dual detection of CEA and Kana is achieved through this whole process of photocurrent flipping and reduction.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas system-based photoelectrochemical biosensors harness the unique properties of photoactive materials and achieve ultra-high sensitivity and low background noise through &#8220;signal-on&#8221; and &#8220;signal-off&#8221; modes.

CRISPR/Cas System-Based Electrochemiluminescence Biosensors</title><p>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a process where electrochemiluminescent substances undergo an electrochemical reaction on the electrode surface, simultaneously triggering a luminescent reaction. This combines the advantages of both electrochemistry and chemiluminescence, offering high sensitivity, a wide linear range, simple operation, and low background signals. QDs and metal nanoparticles are commonly used to construct ECL biosensors.</p><p>A highly sensitive ECL biosensor was developed by Lin et al. for detecting DNA adenine methylation methyltransferase (Dam MTase), achieving a low detection limit of 23.4 mU/mL through a dual-signal amplification process [<xref rid="B71-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The logarithm of Dam MTase concentration showed a good linear relationship with ECL signal intensity in the range of 5 to 70 U/mL. The high sensitivity of this biosensor is mainly due to the low background ECL signal. This is achieved by modifying the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode surface with a Nafion polymer membrane, which creates electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged signal units and the electrode surface, reducing ECL intensity. Additionally, the signal probe Ru-MOF/ssDNA-Fc consists of a ruthenium-based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ru-PEI-L-lys-ZIF-8) linked to ferrocene (Fc) via ssDNA. The aromatic Fc has a low oxidation potential, inhibiting the oxidation of Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup> and thereby suppressing the ECL signal. Fc<sup>+</sup> further quenches the ECL signal produced by Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup>/TPrA through energy transfer (with Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+*</sup> as the energy donor and Fc<sup>+</sup> as the energy acceptor). In the presence of Dam MTase, hairpin DNA (HP) with methylation recognition sites becomes methylated, activating the specific cleavage activity of the restriction enzyme DPnI. The released ssDNA then acts as an activating strand, initiating the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas12a. The activated Cas12a separates Fc from Ru-MOF, restoring the suppressed ECL signal and allowing Ru-MOF to approach the ITO electrode more easily. The higher the Dam MTase concentration, the stronger the ECL signal.</p><p>There are also some interesting works using Fc quenching probes, but they combine different ECL signal molecules or apply different signal modes.</p><p>Wang et al. used quantum dots to generate ECL signals and used strand displacement amplification (SDA) and dual-particle 3D DNA rollers for cascade signal amplification, designing an ECL biosensor for detecting <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> 16S rDNA (Ec-16S rDNA) (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A) [<xref rid="B72-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This biosensor has a wide response range (100 aM&#8211;10 nM) and a low detection limit (27.29 aM). In the presence of Ec-16S rDNA, ssDNA strands DFP 1 and DFP 2 undergo an SDA reaction, producing a large amount of the SP 1 sequence. Hairpin DNA (HP 1) and track DNA are modified on Au NPs. SP 1 opens the stem-loop of HP 1, enabling dual-particle 3D DNA roller replication with track DNA. The introduced Nb endonuclease cuts specific regions of the rollers, generating SP 2 sequences that activate the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage function of Cas12a.

However, in real samples, the Raman signal intensity of biomolecules at very low concentrations is usually too weak to detect. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhances the signal through the influence of surface plasmons on metal surfaces, making SERS a highly sensitive and portable tool suitable for the on-site detection of low-concentration biomolecules.</p><p>Pan et al., cleverly utilizing Prussian Blue (PB) nanolabels, designed a SERS biosensor to detect adulterants in goat milk [<xref rid="B77-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The activated <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas12a releases PB NPs.

Since biological molecules do not typically generate signals in this region, background noise is extremely low, achieving a low detection limit for the target DNA of 224 aM. The Raman intensity difference &#916;<italic toggle="yes">I</italic> is linearly related to the target DNA concentration.</p><p>Researchers have also made corresponding attempts to analyze whether it is possible to realize the detection of target molecules directly by CRISPR/Cas system-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering biosensors without pre-amplification.</p><p>For the sensitive detection of various viral DNAs, Jin-Ha Choi et al. constructed a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) biosensor without the need for amplification steps, enabling the detection of HBV, human papillomavirus HPV-16, and HPV-18 within a concentration range of 1 aM to 100 pM (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B) [<xref rid="B74-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. First, a TANF array composed of periodic triangle Au micropattern and Au nanoflowers structures was constructed. Then, graphene oxide (GO) was modified on its surface. The highly concentrated surface electrons, specially designed micro/nanostructures, and the charge transfer mechanism induced by graphene oxide significantly enhanced the SERS signal on the TANF surface. The surface was also modified with functionalized gold nanoparticle Raman probes (RAuNPs) linked with ssDNA. When the target viral DNA activated the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas12a, the RAuNPs left the GO-TANF surface, causing a sharp decrease in the SERS signal. The degree of change in the SERS signal reflects the concentration of the target virus.</p><p>Yin et al. developed a SERS biosensor, which was based on the CRISPR-Cas12a system for amplification-free nucleic acid detection (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C) [<xref rid="B75-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The ingenuity of the design lies not merely in the activation or deactivation of the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of Cas12a but in better utilizing SERS through the regulation of the steric hindrance effect and base pairing principle. A core&#8211;satellite Au nanocluster structure with ultra-strong SERS signals was constructed as the Raman reporter molecule, connected by partially complementary DNA pairs (DNA<sub>1</sub> and DNA<sub>2</sub>) linking the surrounding Au<sub>13</sub> NPs to the central Fe@Au<sub>40</sub> NPs.

This results in a more significant reduction in the SERS signal, achieving a lower detection limit (10 aM). This design leverages the regulation of the steric hindrance effect and base pairing principle to make the changes in the SERS signals more pronounced and sensitive.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas system-based SERS biosensors combine the high specificity of CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly Cas12a, with the ultra-sensitive signal amplification of SERS through plasmonic effects on metal surfaces. These biosensors enable the direct, amplification-free detection of nucleic acids at ultra-low concentrations, leveraging strategies such as the &#8220;biological Raman-silent region&#8221; and steric hindrance effects to minimize background noise. Despite their high sensitivity and versatility, challenges remain, including the complex and costly fabrication of SERS substrates and susceptibility to environmental factors like temperature and pH. Future efforts should focus on developing cost-effective, scalable substrate fabrication methods and improving signal stability to unlock their full potential in diagnostics and beyond.</p><p>For a CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensor with optical output signals, the signal output mode of &#8220;off-to-on&#8221; is much better than that of light signals from presence to absence, because it can greatly avoid interference from external conditions and prevent the occurrence of false positives, but the latter is still the majority of existing biosensors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-biosensors-15-00155"><title>3.3. CRISPR/Cas System-Based Biosensors with Other Output Signals</title><p>In addition to optical and electrical signals, CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors can also convert specific biological recognition information into other types of signals, such as magnetic signals and mechanical signals.</p><p>Shen et al. designed a biosensing platform to sensitively detect <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> using the different magnetic properties of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with two sizes (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A) [<xref rid="B78-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Different-sized MNPs primarily function as magnetic separation and signal output agents. To achieve precise control over the binding of the two types of MNPs, the CRISPR-Cas12a system was introduced into this binding process, effectively preventing insufficient crosslinking and nonspecific binding between MNPs and the target. The sensitivity and stability were significantly superior to traditional magnetic resonance sensors (MRS). The MNP<sub>130</sub>-SA and MNP<sub>30</sub>-S<sub>2</sub> probes, surface-modified with streptavidin (SA) and single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA, biotin-S<sub>2</sub>), respectively, can be connected through complementary biotin-modified ssDNA (biotin-S<sub>1</sub>). When the target <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> is present, the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of the CRISPR-Cas12a system is activated, indiscriminately cleaving biotin-S<sub>1</sub>, thereby inhibiting the binding of MNP<sub>130</sub>-SA and MNP<sub>30</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>. The free MNP<sub>30</sub>-S<sub>2</sub> probes, under an external magnetic field, will not be sedimented and separated like the MNP<sub>130</sub>-MNP<sub>30</sub> complex and MNP<sub>130</sub>-SA, remaining well dispersed in the solution. The amount of these unbound MNP<sub>30</sub>-S<sub>2</sub> probes correlates with the concentration of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> in the solution. The dispersion state of MNPs can be visually observed to qualitatively determine the presence of the target. The transverse relaxation time (<italic toggle="yes">T</italic><sub>2</sub>) of the MNP<sub>30</sub>-S<sub>2</sub> probes serves as the reporting signal for quantification, with <italic toggle="yes">T</italic><sub>2</sub> values decreasing as the concentration of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium increases, achieving a detection limit as low as 1.3 &#215; 10<sup>2</sup> CFU mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The method also shows good selectivity in the presence of non-target common foodborne pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>. It not only performs well in detecting pure cultured colonies but also shows satisfactory results in detecting actual chicken samples. This strategy also has expansion potential; by designing appropriate cr-RNA and using other Cas proteins with <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activities, it is expected to detect more pathogenic microorganisms. However, this strategy still relies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, which may complicate the process, and it may require improvement in the future.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors, whose output signal is magnetic transverse relaxation time, have also been explored in ultra-sensitive detection without nucleic acid pre-amplification.</p><p>Wei et al. combined the CRISPR/Cas12a system, plasmid RCA, and enzyme-catalyzed click chemistry to develop a biosensor [<xref rid="B80-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. This biosensor achieves ultra-sensitive detection of methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) in food without the pre-amplification of nucleic acids. The working principle of this magnetic relaxation switching (C-MRS) biosensor is as follows: After the CRISPR system recognizes the <italic toggle="yes">mecA</italic> gene in MRSA, the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of Cas12a is activated, releasing ALP that is fixed on the plasmid via single-stranded DNA. The released ALP hydrolyzes the non-reducing substrate 2-phosphate-l-ascorbic acid trisodium salt (AAP) to produce ascorbic acid (AA), which triggers a click reaction between magnetic probes. The detection of MRSA is then achieved by measuring the change in the <italic toggle="yes">T</italic><sub>2</sub> of unbound magnetic probes (MNP<sub>30</sub>). This method achieves a detection limit as low as 16 CFU/mL, with a wide linear range (10<sup>2</sup>&#8211;10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL), without the need for pre-amplification and no background MRS signal. Through three levels of signal transformation and amplification, the sensitivity is significantly enhanced. The biosensor demonstrates good sensitivity and specificity in the detection of foodborne antibiotic-resistant bacteria in complex matrices, and it also has the potential to be expanded to the detection and analysis of other antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The biosensor demonstrates comparable accuracy to the traditional gold standard qPCR method, with excellent experimental stability, as evidenced by low variability in both intraday and interday measurements.</p><p>The mechanical signal is also a kind of special output signal in addition to the magnetic signal.</p><p>Zeng et al. designed a CRISPR-Cas12a-driven piezoresistive wireless biosensor for the dynamic detection of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related DNA, with convenient signal reading via smartphones [<xref rid="B81-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Utilizing the indiscriminate cleavage ability of the CRISPR-Cas12a system on surrounding ssDNA, magnetic bead&#8211;ssDNA&#8211;gold-platinum nanoparticle conjugates (MB-ssDNA-Au@PtNPs) were introduced as signal transduction tags instead of traditional fluorescent labels to trigger a target-activated gas generation reaction. A flexible cross-shaped electrode-modified MXene-PEDOT:PSS film served as the flexible pressure sensing device, and a 3D-printed Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>-PEDOT:PSS/PDMS film with randomly distributed spine-like bionic microstructures on its surface provided excellent force&#8211;electric conversion capabilities. The biosensor was connected to a Bluetooth system via integrated circuits for data transmission, processing, and storage, enabling real-time visualization of experimental results. The biosensor demonstrated good reproducibility, with intra-batch variation below 5% and inter-batch consistency across a wide concentration range of HPV-16. Compared to traditional fluorescence methods, the detection limit (15.22 pM) was lower. By converting the biomolecular recognition process into a high-pressure signal through gas generation, the pressure-sensitive device converted the pressure signal into an electrical signal, which was then transmitted to a smartphone via an integrated wireless data transmission platform. This three-step signal amplification/signal transmission strategy enhanced both portability and sensitivity.</p><p>A visual biosensor based on a CRISPR/Cas12a system-activated target-triggered SDA reaction and responsive hydrogel was designed by Feng et al. for the quantitative detection of miRNA-let-7a in human serum and cell lysates (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B) [<xref rid="B79-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. This biosensor effectively converts the concentration of miRNA-let-7a into a distance signal, with no need for complex instrumentation, allowing for quantification by simply observing distance changes with the naked eye. This feature makes it promising for rapid clinical diagnostics. The concentration of trypsin affects the hydrolysis of gelatin, which in turn determines the permeability of gelatin-treated filter paper. The differing permeability of the filter paper affects the distance the solution can travel along the cotton thread. This straightforward phenomenon allows for the cleaved ssDNA and the miRNA present in the detection system to be quantitatively detected. Within the concentration range of 10 pM to 10 nM, a logarithmic correlation is observed between the measured distance and miRNA-let-7a concentration, demonstrating excellent linearity in the detection range. This biosensor demonstrates good specificity and reproducibility.</p><p>Biosensors utilizing various CRISPR/Cas systems exhibit distinct characteristics.

This biosensor combines CRISPR/Cas12a with primer-assisted rolling circle amplification (PARCA). An activated Cas12a indistinguishably cleaves the fluorescence quencher (F-Q) probe to generate a fluorescent signal. This mode has a linear detection range from 500 fM to 10 nM. Meanwhile, the F-Q probe is replaced with a single-stranded DNA probe modified with MB at one end (SP-MB). The nanomaterial UIO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> exhibits different adsorption behaviors towards intact and cleaved SP-MB, resulting in distinct electrochemical signals. The intact SP-MB produces a stronger electrochemical signal. This difference in signal allows for the detection of EGFR 19, with a detection limit of 42 aM.</p><p>Not only is the combination of fluorescence signals modes and electrochemical modes common, but colorimetric methods are also often combined with fluorescence modes.</p><p>Fareeha Arshad et al. developed a dual-mode fluorescent/colorimetric biosensor for the detection of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> [<xref rid="B56-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

The fluorescent mode employs a commonly used FAM-labeled fluorescent probe. When ssDNA is cleaved by the activated Cas12a, the fluorescent label is separated from the quencher, resulting in the generation of a fluorescent signal. Meanwhile, the colorimetric mode primarily leverages the enzyme-mimicking activities of CeO<sub>2</sub>. When ssDNA is cleaved by the activated Cas12a, nucleotides are released. The phosphatase-like activity of CeO<sub>2</sub> NZ hydrolyzes the phosphate bonds, releasing phosphate ions (Pi). The peroxidase-like activity of CeO<sub>2</sub> facilitates a colorimetric reaction through substrate oxidation, enabling visual detection.

Additionally, the lack of standardized protocols for dual-mode biosensors hinders their widespread adoption and reproducibility. Compared to single-signal biosensors, dual-mode biosensors provide cross-verified results, reducing the risk of false readings, and their combination of two signal modes enables detection in complex matrices, like blood. Therefore, future research should focus on developing standardized protocols for dual-mode biosensor fabrication and operation to improve reproducibility and comparability.

After pairing with crRNA, the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of Cas12a is activated, disrupting the G4-DNAzyme (the G4/hemin complex exhibits peroxidase-like activity, catalyzing the oxidation of TMB to produce corresponding SERS and fluorescence signals and causing a noticeable color change from blue to yellow under acidic conditions). The fluorescence intensity of blue TMBox, the color intensity of yellow TMBox, and the SERS intensity under the AgNPs substrate in the solution are all weak.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors that rely solely on photothermal signal detection are scarce, but this can be used as a signal output mode in multimodal biosensors.</p><p>Zheng et al. developed a &#8220;CPF-CRISPR&#8221; colorimetric/photothermal/fluorescent multimodal biosensor for the detection of drug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), with a detection limit of 10<sup>1</sup> CFU/mL (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C) [<xref rid="B85-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. This biosensor leverages the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas12a, the enzyme-catalyzed reaction of TMB, and the fluorescence properties of copper nanoclusters formed on a DNA scaffold. A signal probe, MNPs-ssDNA-HRP, is designed as the substrate. In the presence of the target bacterial DNA, CRISPR/Cas12a is activated, cleaving the signal probe and releasing HRP. The free HRP can catalyze the oxidation of TMB, resulting in a visible color change from colorless to yellow. Under 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, the solution turns blue and emits a photothermal signal. The isothermal amplification reaction mediated by TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, which catalyzes the synthesis of poly-T by adding dTTPs to the 3&#8242; hydroxyl end of the primer) is initiated by short DNA strands remaining on magnetic beads. In the presence of AA, Cu<sup>2+</sup> forms CuNCs, using poly-T as a scaffold and generating a fluorescent signal, with the signal intensity correlating with the length of the poly-T.</p><p>Although signal-integrated CRISPR/Cas biosensing systems can output multiple signals, there are large differences in signal sensitivity, stability, and other performance indicators under various modes. In addition, the signal combination modes of dual-modal and multi-modal imaging are relatively fixed, and it is still difficult to combine any two or more signal output modes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-biosensors-15-00155"><title>3.5. Structure-Integrated CRISPR/Cas Biosensing System</title><sec id="sec3dot5dot1-biosensors-15-00155"><title>3.5.1. CRISPR/Cas Biosensors Integrated with Lateral Flow Technology</title><p>Lateral flow biosensor utilizes the movement of the sample along the test strip, with different capture substances set in the test and control line areas to achieve detection. It is low cost, easy to operate, and highly compatible, making it one of the most successful commercial detection tools. Consequently, many CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors are also integrated with lateral flow technology.</p><p>Omar Mukama et al. designed a lateral flow biosensor (LFB) that utilizes the CRISPR/Cas system and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (CIA) technology to detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa, capable of detection even at single-copy clone concentrations in samples. Streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNP-SA) are used as reporter molecules (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A) [<xref rid="B88-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. These molecules react with biotin-modified ssDNA reporter genes to form AuNP-SA-biotin-ssDNA complexes. These complexes are captured by probes on the test line (T line), while excess AuNP-SA reacts with biotin-modified antibodies on the control line (C line) to verify the performance of the biosensor. When the acyltransferase gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is present, the Cas effector protein is activated and cleaves the target and any surrounding ssDNA reporter genes. The DNA probe complementary to the reporter sequence fixed at the T line cannot produce a corresponding signal, but there is still a signal at the C line. Visual inspection of the absence or presence of the T line and C line can determine whether Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is present. By changing the corresponding DNA sequences, they also used a similar sensing mechanism to detect human papillomavirus HPV16 and HPV18 [<xref rid="B89-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Similarly, when the target gene is present, there is a signal at the C line but not at the T line; when the target gene is absent, both the C line and T line appear. Even mismatches in individual bases of the target gene do not affect detection.</p><p>Most CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors combined with lateral flow technology need to be used in combination with nucleic acid pre-amplification technology. Except for loop-mediated isothermal amplification, RPA is also commonly used.</p><p>Wang et al. designed a lateral flow biosensor for analyzing DNA methylation in human serum, which combined a dual methylation-sensitive endonucleases system (<italic toggle="yes">BstUI</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">HhaI</italic>) with the CRISPR/Cas13a system and RPA for the first time [<xref rid="B90-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. This innovative enzyme-cutting strategy, named DESCS, can effectively distinguish methylated DNA from an excess of unmethylated DNA, even at methylation levels as low as 0.01%, and can visually identify methylated DNA at concentrations as low as 200 aM. Taking the SEPT9 gene (SEPT9-mC), which is highly methylated in human colorectal cancer (CRC), as an example, it cannot be recognized by BstUI/HhaI enzymes compared to unmethylated SEPT9-C, thus remaining intact. The intact SEPT9-mC target triggers the RPA reaction, producing a large amount of the dsDNA product bound to the T7 promoter, which is then transcribed into ssRNA by T7, activating the ssRNase activity of Cas13a. This results in the cleavage of the lateral flow reporter gene (a short ssRNA labeled with 5&#8242;-FAM and 3&#8242;-biotin). The uncleaved reporter gene is specifically captured at the C line by binding with Au NP-anti-FAM-antibody and streptavidin. Meanwhile, the cleaved short RNA fragments labeled with FAM form complexes with the Au NP-anti-FAM-antibody, which are captured by antibodies at the T line, producing a dark line. The higher the concentration of methylated DNA, the darker the T line. Unmethylated DNA, on the other hand, only produces a single line at the C line.</p><fig position="anchor" id="biosensors-15-00155-f007" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>The working mechanism of (<bold>A</bold>) CIA-based LFB.

When the target gene is present, the RPA reaction incorporates a biotin label into the target gene, resulting in a large amount of dsDNA amplicons (Biotin-dsDNA) (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B) [<xref rid="B91-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].

As this complex passes through the T line, it is captured by pre-fixed streptavidin, displaying a red color. On the C line, the probe captures free GNPs, showing color regardless of the presence of the target gene. This biosensor can complete the detection process within 30 min, and the T line signal exhibits a good linear relationship with the copy number of targets over a wide range, from 3 &#215; 10<sup>2</sup> to 3 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas biosensors integrated with lateral flow technology are cost-effective, user-friendly, and portable, making them ideal for POCT. The integration of CRISPR/Cas systems significantly enhances their specificity and sensitivity, enabling the detection of targets such as pathogens and methylated DNA through simple modifications of guide RNA (crRNA) and probe sequences. LFBs provide rapid, visual results interpretable without specialized equipment, enhancing accessibility in resource-limited settings. However, many CRISPR/Cas-based LFBs require nucleic acid amplification for high sensitivity, complicating workflows, and visual readouts are often qualitative or semi-quantitative. Future advancements should focus on multiplexed detection, smartphone-based quantification, and amplification-free designs to improve versatility and streamline performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5dot2-biosensors-15-00155"><title>3.5.2. CRISPR/Cas Biosensors Integrated with Microfluidic Technology</title><p>Microfluidic technology offers significant advantages over traditional laboratory tests due to its requirement of small sample volumes, high fluidity, and capability for multiplexed control [<xref rid="B94-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. To achieve high-sensitivity detection of multiple low-concentration targets simultaneously, researchers have integrated microfluidic technology with CRISPR/Cas biosensors.</p><p>Shen et al. developed a microfluidic biosensor named LOC-CRISPR, which can identify multiple common respiratory viruses (such as SARS-CoV-2, H1N1, etc.) and their variants simultaneously and specifically (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C) [<xref rid="B92-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. RNA from the sample is extracted using magnetic beads that can adsorb RNA and a serpentine channel microarray. After undergoing an RPA reaction, CRISPR-specific recognition is performed in five parallel reaction chambers. Special structures and materials are used to prevent cross-interference. In the presence of the target DNA, the nuclease and <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activities of Cas12a are activated, leading to the cleavage of the ssDNA reporter probe. The fluorescent molecule FAM and the quencher BHQ attached to both ends of the probe are separated, producing a fluorescent signal at 520 nm when irradiated with a 480 nm laser. The multi-chamber design also provides information about the variant type of the virus present in the sample.</p><p>Xing et al. designed a microfluidic biosensor that combines the CRISPR/Cas12a system with technology, enabling the simultaneous detection of multiple common foodborne pathogens with LOD below 500 CFU/mL (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D) [<xref rid="B93-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The collected fluorescent signals can be gathered and processed by a smartphone, making the process more convenient and efficient. The sensing principle still employs the commonly used fluorescence recovery mechanism (presence of target molecule&#8212;activation of Cas12a&#8212;cleavage of ssDNA probe&#8212;fluorescence recovery). A unique feature of this design is the use of a finger-actuated, one-way control valve that controls the unidirectional flow of RAA products, preventing potential cross-contamination between the RAA and CRISPR recognition processes.</p><p>Like the above biosensors based on fluorescence output signals, which are based on electrochemical signal output modes, these also use microfluidic structures to prevent possible interference.</p><p>Zhang et al. designed a CRISPR/Cas13a-mediated microfluidic electrochemical biosensor that can detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus within 25 min, with an LOD of 10 aM [<xref rid="B95-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. To prevent interference from nucleases that may degrade crRNA in the sample, the microfluidic module separates the virus lysis and nuclease inactivation steps from the subsequent CRISPR/Cas13a recognition and detection steps. The screen-printed gold electrode is functionalized with MB reporter molecules connected by short ssRNA chains composed solely of uracil (poly20). In the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of Cas13a is activated, leading to the cleavage of poly20. This reduces the MB labeling, resulting in a decrease in the electron transfer rate. Consequently, the square wave voltammetry (SWV) detects a reduced redox peak current.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas biosensors integrated with microfluidic technology enable high-throughput, specific detection of targets using minimal sample volumes. The modular design of microfluidic platforms facilitates efficient workflows and prevents cross-contamination, while diverse signal output modes enhance versatility. These biosensors deliver rapid results within minutes, making them ideal for POCT in resource-limited settings, with reduced reagent costs and waste. However, the fabrication of microfluidic devices with integrated CRISPR/Cas systems is technically challenging and costly, and some designs rely on external equipment for signal readout, potentially limiting accessibility. Future advancements should focus on simplifying fabrication and integrating portable readout systems to broaden their application.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5dot3-biosensors-15-00155"><title>3.5.3. CRISPR/Cas System-Based Portable Biosensors Integrated with Glucometer</title><p>People are pursuing more portable and real-time biological detection methods. Developing new, simpler biosensing mechanisms is one approach, but utilizing existing mature devices to simplify the detection process is equally effective. As one of the most common commercial biosensors, the glucometer is naturally the first choice for researchers.</p><p>Chen et al. developed a portable kanamycin (KAN) biosensor that utilizes an existing glucometer as the detection device and incorporates the CRISPR-Cas12a system to amplify the signal (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A) [<xref rid="B96-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In the presence of KAN, it interacts with specific single-stranded DNA fragments, releasing complementary sequences that can trigger the recognition and hybridization of hairpin probes H1 and H2. This process generates DNA fragments that can be recognized by the crRNA of the CRISPR/Cas system, activating the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of Cas12a. This activity cleaves the single-stranded DNA connecting magnetic beads and invertase. After magnetic separation, the invertase remains in the solution and can convert sucrose into glucose, which is ultimately detected by the glucometer. This biosensor has a broad detection range (1 pM~100 nM), can detect complex samples, and has strong anti-interference capabilities against non-target antibiotics.</p><p>Inspired by the enzyme cascade reactions in living cells, Li et al. designed a CRISPR-mediated cascade reaction (CRISPR-MCR) biosensor (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>B) [<xref rid="B97-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. This biosensor uses a nanoporous membrane to separate the RPA reaction of the target nucleic acid sequence from the recognition and cleavage reaction of the CRISPR/Cas system. The small-pore-sized porous PES membrane is highly hydrophilic, is chemically resistant, and has low protein-binding properties, confining different functional enzymes to their respective reaction chambers effectively. This prevents signal interference from the RPA reaction solution or other biomolecules, reducing the occurrence of false positives and enabling efficient CRISPR-MCR detection. When HIV nucleic acids are present and amplified in the corresponding chamber, the concentration difference allows the amplicons to pass through the nanopores into the CRISPR/Cas system reaction chamber. The activated Cas12a then cleaves the MB-ssDNA-invertase. Magnetic beads are retained in the reaction chamber by a neodymium disk magnet located below the biosensor. Bubbles and water transfer the free invertase to the catalytic chamber, where it hydrolyzes sucrose to produce glucose, which is ultimately detected digitally using a personal glucometer. In practical applications, the CRISPR-MCR biosensor can detect 43 copies of HIV DNA plasmids and 200 copies of HIV RNA, demonstrating clinical performance comparable to RT-PCR methods.</p><p>Not only can positively correlated glucose molecular signals be exploited but also negatively correlated ones.</p><p>Zhou et al. developed a simple biosensor targeting <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> using the CRISPR/Cas12a system and an existing glucometer [<xref rid="B98-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The invA gene serves as the target gene, and through steps including recombinase-aided amplification (RAA), Cas12a <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage of ssDNA, and sucrose hydrolysis, the presence of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> is converted into a glucose signal that can be read by a personal glucometer. This allows for rapid detection with sensitivity as low as 5 CFU per reaction. Unlike most sensors where the glucose concentration detected by the glucometer increases with the initial nucleic acid concentration, this biosensor exhibits a negative correlation between glucose concentration and the initial nucleic acid concentration. This is because the researchers did not use the method of linking magnetic beads with glucose invertase via ssDNA. Instead, magnetic beads and invertase are separately modified on complementary ssDNA strands. Initially, only magnetic beads with ssDNA are added to the system. If the target gene is present, the activated Cas12a will cleave the ssDNA indiscriminately, preventing the magnetic beads from connecting with the invertase and participating in the subsequent sucrose hydrolysis reaction, resulting in a lower signal. This approach avoids potential spatial effects that could arise from directly linking MBs and invertase via ssDNA during Cas12a cleavage. In the mixed detection of standard <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>, clinically isolated <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>, and non-<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> samples, this biosensor demonstrates good specificity, with only samples containing <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> showing a decrease in glucose signal. The signal difference between samples containing <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> and those without is significant. The biosensor also shows good spiked recovery rates in various food samples susceptible to <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> infection.</p><fig position="anchor" id="biosensors-15-00155-f008" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Principle of (<bold>A</bold>) a portable biosensor for on-site kanamycin detection.

Other CRISPR/Cas System-Based Chip-Type Biosensors</title><p>With the increasing demand for detection, integration may become one of the main research directions in the future. Consequently, many researchers have also explored CRISPR/Cas system-based chip-type biosensors.</p><p>Devora Najjar et al. designed a multiplexed electrochemical biosensor chip that can simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins in saliva [<xref rid="B101-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. A portion of the collected saliva sample undergoes isothermal nucleic acid amplification and CRISPR/Cas12 system recognition and <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage, followed by RNA detection using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The signal obtained from the electrochemical platform is inversely proportional to the concentration of the target RNA. Meanwhile, another untreated portion is delivered by a peristaltic pump to other reaction chambers, where an affinity-based antigen sandwich ELISA is performed to detect the corresponding antibodies. Different subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bind to the antigens and secondary antibodies fixed on the chip surface in different pathways, leading to various increases in electrochemical signals. Finally, clinical samples are tested for four categories: (1) RNA-negative, antibody-negative; (2) RNA-positive, antibody-positive; (3) RNA-negative, antibody-positive; and (4) RNA-positive, antibody-negative. All results show high discrimination (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), with ultra-low background signals between positive and negative samples.</p><p>Effective biosensing detection can be achieved by using ratiometric signals instead of absolute quantification. Wu et al. designed a ratio-type biosensor chip named &#8220;RatioCRISPR&#8221; to detect the heterogeneity levels of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) using the CRISPR/Cas12a system (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>C) [<xref rid="B99-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The sensitivity and specificity of this biosensor are enhanced through the strategic introduction of mismatched nucleotides near critical recognition sites. The ratio measurement system consists of two different crRNAs: one is SNP-crRNA, which is complementary to the mutant type and mismatched with the wild type, and the other is WT-crRNA, which is the opposite (non-complementary to the mutant type and matched with the wild type). Both crRNAs detect the same target simultaneously. When the mutant target is present, the SNP-crRNA generates a high signal, and the WT-crRNA generates a low signal; conversely, when encountering the wild-type target, the signals are reversed. This differential signaling mechanism enables the rapid assessment of target heterogeneity levels. This design not only improves the sensitivity of detection but also enhances the ability to distinguish signals from different genotypes, making the detection of SNPs in mitochondrial DNA more accurate and efficient.</p><p>The exceptional electrical and surface properties of graphite also make it advantageous as CRISPR/Cas system-based chip-type biosensors.</p><p>Reza Hajian et al. reported a FET biosensor chip based on functionalized graphene, called CRISPR-Chip, which uses CRISPR technology to detect target sequences in intact genomic samples [<xref rid="B102-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The chip comprises a complex of catalytically deactivated Cas9 protein (dCas9) and single-guide RNA (sg-RNA) designed for specific sequences. This complex is anchored to the surface of the graphene channel using molecular linkers, forming a dRNP complex that serves as the channel between the source and drain electrodes of the transistor. The high specificity and sensitivity of CRISPR-Cas allow it to scan intact genomic samples and hybridize with specific complementary sequences. The high carrier mobility of graphene makes it extremely sensitive to the adsorption and interaction of surface-charged molecules. Therefore, when the target sequence is present, the dRNP complex can quickly locate and bind to it, altering the electrical properties of the gFET and generating an electrical signal output. The percentage change in the current (I-response) within 15 min is significantly higher than in samples lacking the target sequence. For clinical DNA samples with common gene mutations in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the detection limit is 1.7 fM, which is lower than previously reported non-amplification technologies. In addition to detecting other target nucleic acids by changing the type of Cas protein, CRISPR-Chip also has the capability to provide information on the affinity between sgRNA and various Cas proteins. This chip is helpful for predicting and validating the formation efficiency of CRISPR complexes under various conditions as well.</p><p>Zheng et al. developed a biosensor chip named CRISPR-SPR-Chip by combining the specific recognition ability of the CRISPR/Cas system, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, and a 2D graphdiyne structure [<xref rid="B103-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. This chip can be used for the clinical screening of patients with certain hereditary diseases caused by gene mutations, such as DMD. The introduction of graphdiyne films not only provides the chip with a better protein (i.e., dCas9 nuclease) loading capacity but also enhances the SPR signal response due to its electromagnetic field coupling effect with the Au metal layer. The biosensor exhibits high sensitivity, with a detection limit of 1.3 fM for recombinant plasmids with only three nucleobase mutations. It also offers rapid detection without the need for pre-amplification steps, producing significant positive results from patient samples within 5 min.</p><p>Wu et al. developed a chip-based visual biosensor for the convenient detection of genetically modified (GM) soybean flour, capable of simultaneously detecting the CaMV35S promoter and the lectin gene (<xref rid="biosensors-15-00155-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>D) [<xref rid="B100-biosensors-15-00155" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. This biosensor combines the CRISPR/Cas12a system with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) on a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) chip. When the target gene is detected, the ssDNA nuclease activity of the Cas12a is activated, cleaving the surrounding ssDNA fluorescent probes. Upon illumination with a 490 nm LED light, a visual detection result is obtained; green fluorescence indicates a positive sample, while black fluorescence indicates a negative sample. Since the entire chip-based biosensor operates in a closed system, it effectively addresses the issues of amplicon contamination and non-specific amplification that previous methods might encounter. This biosensor chip can detect GM content as low as 0.1% in soybean flour and can also differentiate whether food samples contain only one of the two transgenic components, the CaMV35S promoter or the lectin gene, demonstrating good sensitivity and specificity.</p><p>Chip-type biosensors integrate CRISPR/Cas systems with multiple functional components into a compact platform, enabling high-throughput and multiplexed detection. Their miniaturized design enhances automation and portability, making them ideal for POCT. However, the complexity of their structural design poses challenges for fabrication and scalability. These biosensors are particularly well suited for integration with smartphone-based readouts, offering user-friendly, real-time detection capabilities.</p><p>Structure-integrated CRISPR/Cas biosensing systems are generally simpler in terms of readout and on-site detection operations, but they still mostly require nucleic acid pre-amplification and are complex in their structure design and combination.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-biosensors-15-00155"><title>4. Conclusions and Prospects</title><p>Although various types of CRISPR/Cas biosensors have been studied and are continuously being developed, most constructed biosensors are still combined with methods such as fluorescence, colorimetry, and electrochemistry. There is still insufficient exploration of their combinations with many novel biosensing methods. The use of the CRISPR/Cas system is concentrated on the <italic toggle="yes">trans-</italic>cleavage activity of a few Cas proteins, and whether more effects can be utilized is worth exploring.</p><p>Research on the intelligence, simplicity, and wearable ability of biosensors is gradually becoming a focal point. However, there is still little exploration of CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors in these areas, which may be a direction worth pursuing in the future. Due to the limitation of target molecule concentration, many CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors still rely on various nucleic acid amplification methods, increasing the complexity of the detection process. Although many non-amplification CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors have emerged, the question of how to better design sensing mechanisms and simplify the detection process is still worth considering. Among the signal readout modes, electrochemical and fluorescence readouts are currently the most promising for non-amplification CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors due to their high sensitivity, portability, and compatibility with point-of-care applications. However, SERS- and FET-based readouts also hold significant potential for ultra-sensitive and multiplexed detection. Enhancing the multiplexing capabilities of CRISPR/Cas system-based biosensors and developing all-in-one biosensors are essential for advancing their practical applications.</p><p>Each CRISPR/Cas biosensor based on optical, electrical, magnetic, and mechanical output signals has their own characteristics, but no CRISPR/Cas biosensors based on acoustic output signals have yet been found.
