These physical and chemical factors can directly cause irritation and damage to lung tissue, disrupting the barrier function of the respiratory tract and increasing the risk of pathogen infection. Imaging techniques play a crucial role in the detection of lung diseases. One of the first choices for the diagnosis of lung diseases is CT,<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref> which clearly shows the structure of the lungs and has a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting inflammation, tumors, nodules, and other lesions, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. MRI can clearly show the soft tissue structure of the lungs,<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref> which is important for determining whether a lung tumour has invaded blood vessels, nerves, and other structures in the mediastinum. In addition, ultrasound imaging can scan human organs using ultrasound probes that emit ultrasound beams. As these beams propagate inside human tissues, they generate reflection and scattering phenomena. The reflected ultrasound signals are then received by the probe, and after transmission, amplification, and processing, an image is formed and displayed on the screen. However, since the lungs contain a large amount of air, this air appears as a low signal on MRI images, affecting the observation of the lungs' fine structures. This fundamental physical limitation demands innovative computational approaches for pulmonary image reconstruction. Neuromorphic chips with in-memory computing capabilities can implement compressed sensing algorithms directly at the sensor interface, reconstructing high-fidelity lung MRI images.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Bone disease</title><p id="p0040">Fractures, i.e., disruption of the integrity of the bone, are usually caused by external forces acting on the bone, such as falls, traffic accidents, and sports injuries.<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref> These external forces may act directly on the bone, causing it to break, or they may cause the bone to fracture at a site remote from the point of action of the force, through conduction or leverage.

As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(g), the electrical and sensing properties of the device were significantly enhanced by crumpled MXene nanosheets. Inspired by the biological synaptic signaling mode, AChR was used for testing the sensing property of the NR-S device by modifying it at the third-terminal MXene-PBS electrode interface, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(h). It was found that NR-S devices based on crumpled MXene nanosheets could produce resistivity changes at ultra-low acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations (1 aM) after AChR modification, which was 10<sup>3</sup> times lower than that of NR-S devices based on flat MXene nanosheets. With increasing ACh levels (from 1 aM to 1 &#8203;&#956;M), the device conductivity shows an increasing trend. This sensing property of NR-S-based devices is similar to the plastic behavior of neural synapses. When continuing to modify the damaging autoreceptor antibody (AChR-ab), as the amount of antibody increased, the sensing range of the NR-S device for neurotransmitters decreased, and the sensitivity for neurotransmitter detection also decreased, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(i).

As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(l), when a positive gate voltage is applied, cations from the epinephrine solution intercalate into the PEDOT:PSS channel. Due to the presence of these intercalated ions, the distance between the PEDOT:PSS backbones increases, leading to a decrease in conductance. Therefore, an excitatory response is observed when exposed to acetylcholine solution. On the other hand, the device exhibited an inhibitory response to epinephrine solution. Inhibitory synapses were simulated when a positive voltage pulse (ranging from 6 to 9 &#8203;V, with a step size of 150 &#8203;mV and a pulse width of 0.1 &#8203;s) was applied to the gate electrode, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(m). As depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(n), when excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic inputs are balanced, the postsynaptic neuron's response remains within the saturated range. In this saturated state, the synaptic inputs applied to the postsynaptic neuron, both excitatory and inhibitory, are of comparable strength. These excitatory and inhibitory responses counteract each other, establishing a state of equilibrium. When the amplitude of the excitatory stimulus increases, the postsynaptic neuron transmits an excitatory signal, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(o). Meanwhile, when the inhibitory stimulus is stronger than the excitatory stimulus, the postsynaptic neuron transmits an inhibitory signal, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(p). To simulate these excitatory-inhibitory equilibrium properties, acetylcholine and epinephrine solutions were used to represent excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic neurons, respectively, which were then dropped into the PEDOT:PSS channel. Positive and negative voltage pulses were applied to the solutions containing acetylcholine and epinephrine, respectively, to obtain the equilibrium properties, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(q). The inhibitory dominance operation was simulated by applying an excitatory input at an amplitude of -2V, while gradually increasing the amplitude of the inhibitory pulse from 1V to 4V (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(r)).

In the first training cycle (Cycle I), the chloride sensor and potassium sensor served as inputs X1 and X2, respectively. Once the neuromorphic circuit was fully trained to correctly classify cystic fibrosis, the neuromorphic device exhibited electrical conductance such that the weights accurately separated the different cases. Immediately thereafter, in the second training cycle (Cycle II), the sensors were connected to different inputs of the neuromorphic circuit, with the potassium sensor serving as input X1 and the chloride sensor serving as input X2. However, in this scenario, the system once again produced incorrect outputs. The weights are readjusted to further train the circuit until the disease can be correctly classified once again, ensuring that all input samples produce accurate outputs. This demonstrates the versatility of on-chip learning, which can utilize any type of sensor in combination with labeled data. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to classify signals even when data separation is not readily apparent.

For instance, using equipment like X-rays, CT, and MRIs, doctors can non-invasively examine patients and obtain pertinent information on issues such as organ function, tumors, infectious diseases, and bone fractures. Neuromorphic devices have demonstrated numerous advantages in medical image diagnostics, not only in terms of high speed and accuracy, but also in their exceptional ability to process complex image data and significant improvements in energy efficiency. Compared with traditional computer processors, neuromorphic devices are able to identify and analyze features in images more quickly, thereby reducing diagnostic time and enhancing diagnostic efficiency. Especially when processing complex medical images, such as MRIs, neuromorphic devices are capable of identifying the area and type of lesion with greater accuracy, providing doctors with a more reliable basis for diagnosis.

To efficiently implement the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on a memristor array, the authors developed two strategies: quasi-analogue mapping (QAM) and complex matrix transfer (CMT) schemes. These schemes improve the mapping accuracy and transfer efficiency, respectively. When using QAM, the memristor-based DFT results are consistent with those obtained through software computation, in contrast to the conventional quantized mapping (QM) approach. With CMT, the memristor-based DFT requires fewer peripheral circuits compared to the traditional real-virtual separation scheme.

The SNEN consists of stretchable components, including carbon nanotube (CNT) strain sensors, organic semiconductor nanowires, and ion-gel stretchable synaptic transistors, as well as soft hydrogel electrodes. To demonstrate the concept, the SNEN was attached to the legs or backs of mice, as shown in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>(b).

The technological evolution of rehabilitation medical engineering has posed multidimensional challenges to neuromorphic devices: at the hardware level, this requires both the construction of millisecond-level motion-sensing closed-loop systems for precise bionic control of prostheses and breakthroughs in maintaining synaptic plasticity under sustained mechanical loading. Meanwhile, the fundamental conflict between biocompatibility and high-density sensing integration continues to hinder the clinical translation of haptic interfaces. In the algorithmic dimension, the imbalance between nociceptive inhibition and proprioceptive enhancement in neurofeedback systems risks misaligning motion perception during prolonged use, while bottlenecks in cooperative learning between EMG signals and neuromorphic networks have stalled the dynamic adaptation of rehabilitation devices. This multilevel technical challenge not only catalyzes cross-disciplinary integration among materials science, biomechanics, and neuroengineering but also drives the development of innovative paradigms such as bionic tactile interfaces and adaptive closed-loop regulation in rehabilitation medicine.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><label>4.4</label><title>Brain-machine interfaces</title><p id="p0175">Brain-machine interface (BMI) captures brain signals and converts them into electrical signals, thereby realizing visual detection of these brain signals.<xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr"><sup>137</sup></xref> BMI can be categorized into two types: implantable BMI and non-implantable BMI. For implantable BMI, the signal acquisition device (electrode) is directly implanted into the patient's cerebral cortex through surgery or other means. This method boasts high accuracy, high temporal resolution, and a high information transmission rate, among other advantages. However, it also poses challenges such as high surgical risk, a high infection rate, and significant implantation trauma. Non-implantable BMI does not require surgery and can collect brain signals directly from outside the brain. However, at the same time, due to the signal attenuation caused by the skull and the blurring effect of electric field dispersion, the signal resolution is low, making it difficult to identify the brain area or individual neurons associated with the signal emission. Additionally, the signal cannot be transmitted if the conductive paste fails.<xref rid="bib138" ref-type="bibr"><sup>138</sup></xref> Therefore, the development of new BMIs becomes particularly important for the transmission of neural signals.

Electrochemical sensors convert chemical signals into electrical signals and affect the memristor. The resistive state of the memristor is modulated by DA as a signal, which can mimic the STP and LTP of synapses. A polymer hydrogel with temperature-dependent properties was used to simulate how interneurons release DA. In this artificial neuron, the DA electrochemical sensor in combination with the memristor constitutes a neurotransmitter-mediated artificial synapse, as shown in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>(c), which enables both neurotransmitter recognition and memory capabilities. To verify the perceptual memory ability, different concentrations of DA were used as presynaptic stimuli, and the electrical response of the artificial synapse was monitored.

Specifically, the authors constructed a memristor-based FIR filter as a preprocessor; and a memristor-based single-layer perceptron neural network as a decoder&#8212;to perform the typical BMI task of identifying epilepsy-related brain states from recorded neural signals, as shown in <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>(a). Frequency-dependent information in neural signals aids in distinguishing between different brain states. Therefore, a FIR filter array with four bands of bass filters was designed and implemented using memristors to generate waveforms in the corresponding frequency bands, as shown in <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>(a). <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>(b) shows how the neural signal is filtered in the memristor array. The coefficients of the filter are first mapped onto the memristor array as device conductance values. Fragments of analogue voltage signals containing information about the state of the brain (i.e., normal, interictal, or ictal) are then applied to the memristor array. The sum of the output currents is the result of filtering by the filter bank at each time step. In this way, the memristor array filters the input neural signal into four frequency bands (&#948;, &#952;, &#945;, and &#946;) with waveforms reflecting the corresponding brain states. Several biomarkers, such as waveform amplitude and energy per frequency band, were subsequently extracted as feature parameters and input into a single-layer perceptron neural network to identify epilepsy-related brain states. To verify that the filtering results retained sufficient information for identifying brain states, the authors further constructed a single-layer perceptron neural network consisting of 21 input neurons, with output neurons located in another array of memristors. To compare the performance of software computation with that of the memristor-based filter set, the authors created two datasets: dataset S, consisting of all biomarkers extracted from software computation results, and dataset M, consisting of all biomarkers extracted from the filtered waveforms of the memristor array. <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>(c) shows the input feature vectors for the 540 test samples.

It is expected that this problem can be mitigated by using larger neural networks or adopting new training strategies. In addition to achieving high accuracy, the memristor-based analogue computing system offers an attractive platform for designing low-power, high-efficiency BMI neural signal analysis systems. To compare the performance of the memristor-based system with that of a state-of-the-art CMOS-based ASIC, the authors evaluated the power efficiencies of both systems, as shown in <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>(g). The memristor array-based system achieves an excellent power efficiency of 1.4 &#956;W/level, where most of the power is consumed by the filter bank due to the relatively small size of the perceptron network used for recognition. In comparison, the power efficiency of a typical CMOS system is estimated to be 551.0 &#956;W/level. Thus, compared to state-of-the-art CMOS systems, memristor-based systems exhibit an approximately 400-fold advantage in power efficiency.

Additionally, this paper delves into the application prospects of neuromorphic devices in the field of medical image processing. By processing and analyzing various common medical image types, including X-rays, MRI, CT, and others, neuromorphic devices demonstrate great potential in medical image recognition, diagnosis, and assisted treatment. Meanwhile, this review underscores the innovative applications of neuromorphic devices in rehabilitation medical engineering and the breakthroughs they have accomplished. Notably, in the areas of afferent neural network construction and e-skin design, neuromorphic devices have infused new vitality into the progress of rehabilitation medical engineering, leveraging their unique advantages to provide more precise and efficient solutions for patients' rehabilitation treatment and functional recovery. Finally, the article also comprehensively examines the latest research findings and development trends of neuromorphic devices in the fields of neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces. These studies have demonstrated that neuromorphic devices possess significant potential for achieving seamless connections between the brain and external devices. They offer new insights and directions for neuroscience research, the advancement of brain-computer interface technology, and future innovations in human-computer interaction. Furthermore, all these studies indicate that neuromorphic devices exhibit lower power consumption and higher performance compared to conventional electronic devices. This renders them more promising for a broader range of applications in biomedical engineering, particularly in scenarios that necessitate prolonged monitoring and treatment. The low power consumption aids in extending the device's lifespan while minimizing disruption to the patient's daily life. The research of neuromorphic devices in the field of biomedical engineering has made great progress. However, with the improvement of people's living standards and medical needs, as well as the increasing importance of cross-disciplinary disciplines such as biomedical engineering, the development of neuromorphic devices is still faced with many challenges, including device biocompatibility, personalized demand handling, and clinical validation, which urgently require further in-depth research and solutions(<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>).<xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr"><sup>144</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr"><sup>145</sup></xref><list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>(1)</label><p id="p0200">Biocompatibility refers to the ability of biomaterials to come into contact with living biological tissues and body fluids without causing a decline in the function of cells and tissues, or inducing inflammation, cancerous changes, rejection reactions, and other adverse effects.<xref rid="bib146" ref-type="bibr"><sup>146</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr"><sup>147</sup></xref> In biomedical engineering, the biocompatibility of neuromorphic devices is crucial for their successful clinical application. To reduce the occurrence of immune reactions and rejection, materials with excellent biocompatibility are selected. Emerging generative AI models are accelerating this process by predicting novel biocompatible material combinations through multi-parameter optimization of chemical properties and biological interaction profiles. The surface of neuromorphic devices is modified using chemical, physical, or biological methods to enhance their compatibility with biological tissues. Additionally, flexible materials and techniques can be employed to design neuromorphic devices that possess flexibility. Such designs can better accommodate morphological changes in biological tissues and minimize damage and discomfort during implantation, thereby improving the biocompatibility of the devices. Furthermore, during the preparation process, researchers must strictly control the experimental environment to ensure the sterile fabrication of neuromorphic devices. This helps to decrease the risk of infection after implantation and further enhances biocompatibility. By integrating these approaches, the widespread adoption of neuromorphic devices in biomedical engineering can be facilitated, thereby making a significant contribution to the advancement of the medical field.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="simple" id="olist0015"><list-item id="o0015"><label>(2)</label><p id="p0205">In the field of biomedical engineering, personalized needs pertain to the characteristics of a treatment plan or rawmedical device that is tailored to each patient based on factors such as individual differences, physiological status, disease type, and severity.<xref rid="bib148" ref-type="bibr"><sup>148</sup></xref> This concept of customization aims to maximize treatment effectiveness, minimize side effects, and enhance the quality of life and satisfaction of patients. For neuromorphic devices, enhancing their ability to meet patients' personalized needs entails not only considering the functionality and biocompatibility of the device, but also accounting for the specific conditions of the patient to achieve precision medicine. AI-powered digital twin technology creates patient-specific physiological models to simulate device performance, enabling virtual prototyping of customized neuromorphic solutions before physical implantation. First, a modular design concept is adopted, allowing the functions of each part of the neuromorphic device to be replaced or upgraded independently. In this manner, doctors can flexibly select or adjust the functional modules of the device according to the patient's specific conditions, thereby achieving a more personalized treatment plan. Second, an effective patient feedback mechanism is established, incorporating information such as pain perception. This information is crucial for adjusting the design, function, and parameters of the neuromorphic device, enabling the achievement of customized treatments that are even more tailored to the patient's needs.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0020"><label>(3)</label><p id="p0210">Clinical validation is the systematic and scientific evaluation of a treatment, medical device, or drug to determine its safety, efficacy, and applicability in medical research and clinical practice. For neuromorphic devices, clinical validation is a critical step to ensure their safe and effective use in biomedical engineering. Based on the intended use and performance characteristics of the neuromorphic device, the objectives of clinical validation are clearly defined, including assessing the device's safety, efficacy, stability, and patient acceptance. AI-driven predictive modeling significantly enhances trial design efficiency by identifying optimal patient cohorts and predicting potential adverse event probabilities through retrospective analysis of historical medical datasets. Collect basic patient data and follow up on treatment outcomes and patient feedback after the neuromorphic device is used. Establish a control group to compare patients using the neuromorphic device with those not using it, in order to assess the therapeutic effect of the device. Conduct clinical validation in various medical centers to expand the sample size and enhance the representativeness and credibility of the validation results. A comprehensive data collection system should also be established to ensure the completeness, accuracy, and traceability of the data. This system should include the collection of patients' baseline data, physiological indicators during treatment, imaging results, and patients' subjective feedback. Meanwhile, researchers need to refer to relevant regulations, guidelines, and standards both domestically and internationally to formulate clinical validation criteria and evaluation indexes for neuromorphic devices. Through the comprehensive application of these methods, the safety and effectiveness of neuromorphic devices in clinical applications can be ensured, thereby promoting their widespread application and development in the field of biomedical engineering.</p></list-item></list><fig id="fig14" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption><p>The research line of neuromorphic chips in the field of biomedical engineering includes three aspects: biocompatibility, Individual-based treatment and clinical validation.
