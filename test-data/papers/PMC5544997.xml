They are supposed to provide hospitals and health centers with qualified engineers in the areas of diagnosis, therapy, rehabilitation and research. The program offered at any department of biomedical engineering has to improve and to develop depending on the evolving inputs and local/global circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], especially those related to medicine and biology. However, many BM engineers suffer from the &#8220;easier said than done&#8221; work in medical fields or interaction with medical practitioners. The difficulty is mainly produced by the fragile medical content in many courses in BME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Improvement of those courses is essential for complexity reduction. Furthermore, several calls are being proposed to develop, assess or improve programs that can attract students or medical practitioners/students who desire biomedical engineering based learning in medical context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (e.g. pathology informatics, medical devices, genetic computation&#8230;etc.); The improvement of medical content in the curriculum should therefore be very carefully targeted. Consequently, in the process of continuous improvement in a BME department, measures should be taken to remedy the eventual shortcomings related to the medical and biological content in its courses and study plan (curriculum).</p><p id="Par21">Traditionally, courses were defined in terms of their duration, syllabus and content (Content-based education). Clear statement as to what students were expected to learn was not on the agenda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, Outcome-Based Education (OBE) is the approach where decisions about the curriculum are driven by the outcomes the students should display by the end of the course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It provides an explicit statement of what the curriculum is setting out to achieve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The transfer of education system from the traditional approach to Outcome Based Education (OBE) had given a significant change in many educational institutions worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The main elements/phases of OBE are: defining learning outcomes, outcome-based development of curriculum, outcome-based curriculum assessment and outcome-based continuous improvement. The implementation of OBE implies the interaction between all stakeholders: students, instructors, faculty, educational environment, course/curriculum planning/assessment committees and advisory board.</p><p id="Par22">In the first phase, outcomes should encompass skills, abilities, and knowledge that the students should attain by the time of their graduation. Several interrelated dimensions should be considered. The key characteristics for the identification of medical learning outcomes have been established by a number of studies. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a three-circle outcome model has been adopted: outcomes related to the performance of tasks expected, outcomes related to the approach adopted by the doctor to the performance of tasks, and outcomes related to professionalism. The design down process for development of outcomes has been summarized as: (1) generation of exit outcomes, (2) phase outcomes, (3) course outcomes and finally (4) lesson outcomes.</p><p id="Par23">In the second phase, Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy is one of the important approaches for designing educational learning processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It comprises aspects related to creating, evaluating, analyzing, applying, understanding and remembering.</p><p id="Par24">In the third phase, OBE is more than a traditional method that is only based on GPA and course completion. It has been indicated by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] that the correct type of Learning Outcomes Assessment for higher education should integrate several components that are instructor-based and student-based to give an accurate picture of attainment of the learning outcomes. The New World Kirkpatrick Model is the worldwide standard for evaluating the effectiveness of teaching. It considers the value of teaching across four levels: reaction, learning, behavior and results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Reaction level is the degree to which students find the teaching favorable, engaging and relevant. Learning level is the degree to which students acquire the intended knowledge, skills, attitude, confidence and commitment. The third level is the degree to which students apply what they learned. The last level is the degree to which short-term observations and measurements suggest that critical behaviors are on track to create a positive impact on desired results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Direct measures of assessment are measures in which the products of student work are evaluated (ex. activities from coursework) while indirect measures of assessment are those in which students judge their own ability to achieve the learning outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Qualitative assessment involves open-ended interviews and questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], observations (notes, checklists, rubric.etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], records and documents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, whenever criteria are used with a qualitative method, the process of inductive discovery is diminished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. On the other hand, the quantitative approach comprises structured interviews, questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and tests. It can be generalized and customized more easily than qualitative methods. The most used tools are student, alumni and employer surveys, performance assessment, rubrics, portfolios, general knowledge and skill measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Surveys are easily administered but do not guarantee direct evidence of student learning. The most authentic tool is the external performance assessment. However, it is not easy to implement.</p><p id="Par25">In the fourth phase, a failure to achieve the agreed outcomes almost certainly identifies a problem with the curriculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]: good curriculum means good study progress. Improvement of the curriculum should be based on the assessment results and eventual modifications of outcomes based on local/global circumstances.</p><p id="Par26">As will be detailed later in the discussion section, improvement of medical content in BME curriculum based on qualitative assessment processes, comparison with high-standard programs or implicit inter-relation between the medical content and the BME expected technical outcomes has been approached by a number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, the major limitations of the previous research are the high dependence on surveys or pure qualitative approaches as well as the absence of strong focus on medical outcomes without implicit confusion with the technical ones. The proposed work presents the development and evaluation of an accurate/robust quantitative approach to the improvement of the medical content in the challenging multidisciplinary BME curriculum which includes mixed technology and biomedicine elements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par27">The main goals of the present work are: (1) the clear and accurate identification of student medical outcomes SOsM (satisfying the requirements of Outcome Based Education) without confusion with technical outcomes, (2) the separate quantitative assessment of every medical outcome &amp; the robust quantitative assessment of every medical outcome by multiple quantitative assessment formats (different direct and indirect tools) that complement each other and increase accuracy, (3) the precise targeted evaluation/improvement of curriculum medical content in light of quantitative assessment results, and finally (4) the implementation intended for more explanation about the approach evaluation. The present work takes the BME Department at Jordan University of Sciences and Technology (JUST) as an example to which the methodology of the paper is applied. The department is the first of its kind in Jordan. The BME program at JUST was granted accreditation by the Engineering Accreditation Commission EAC (USA) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) effective 2007. Renewal of accreditation was granted as well in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. ABET is a non-profit and non-governmental organization, in the United States of America, that accredits university programs in the fields of applied science, computing, engineering and engineering technology based on high graduates quality and department standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The mentioned department adopts a plan targeting particularly the aspects related to the assessment of the BME mission statement, program educational objectives (PEOs) and student outcomes (SOs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] by maintaining the BME program constituencies-feedback regular analysis. The process starts by defining the BME program educational objectives (PEOs) from which emerge student outcomes (SOs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], since outcomes are the most important part of the educational process. Also, sub-outcomes are defined for each course in the program, based on the material in each course, and are linked to the students&#8217; outcomes. In the implementation section, only the elements of assessment/improvement interesting to international readers will be introduced without presentation of the special details related to the BME department at JUST University.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of student outcomes related to biomedicine (SO<sc>s</sc>M)</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Program constituencies</title><p id="Par28">The significant primary constituents of the program are:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par29">Faculty members of the BME program: The faculty members strongly contribute to the advancement of their department.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Engagement in interrelated dimensions</title><p id="Par35">One of the most important raised issues during the process of establishing the goals of the BME program at the department was the conviction that students get engaged in several interrelated dimensions that have substantial impact on forming students&#8217; characters for their future careers. The dimensions are categorized as follows: D1. Scholarship and knowledge, D2. Intellectual communication, D3. Community building, D4. Leadership, and D5. Spirituality and values. These dimensions stem mainly from the principles that underline the adult learning process. BME Students are engaged in the interrelated dimensions contributing to the development of the whole biomedical engineer as a person. In D1, the goal is that the students become distinguished scholars in their field of choice, be dedicated to advancement of knowledge, and prepared for higher studies and fruitful careers as well as lifelong learning. The indicators relevant to this dimension include: being prepared for higher study, being prepared for a future career, demonstrating substantial general knowledge and coping well with the core field of study. In D2, the qualities of intellectual communication are necessary for student effective learning, clear idea expression, and successful application of knowledge acquired to new situations. The indicators relevant to this dimension are: utilizing modern methods and tools, adopting and applying resources, demonstrating the skills of communication (oral and in-writing), critical thinking (synthesis, evaluation, analysis, integration, and application) and problem-solving. In D3, this dimension intends to build an inclusive community by working on welcoming collaboration with others regardless of their ethnic group, faith, or gender. An inclusive community leads to building noble values of respect and compassion to human life and dignity. Indicators relevant to this dimension include: working collaboratively with others, and demonstrating acceptance of others with respect to their differences. In D4, students are motivated and encouraged to take the initiative to get engaged voluntarily in local and global issues of significance. Indicators relevant to this dimension include: demonstration of an understanding of the interconnectedness of global and local concerns, and recognition of contemporary issues. In D5, this dimension aims at helping students determine the set of principles that guide their actions and define their relationships with others. Indicators relevant to this dimension include: defining and articulating one&#8217;s own values and beliefs, and making informed ethical decisions in personal and professional situations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Program educational objectives (PEOs)</title><p id="Par36">The process starts by defining the BME program objectives from which emerge student outcomes (described in the next section), since outcomes are the most important part of the educational process. The program educational objectives should encompass the student outcomes and be consistent with university, faculty, department and program missions as well as with the above inter-related dimensions. All the vision and mission statements as well as PEOs are published in JUST website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">In the beginning of the educational process, the Program Educational Objectives are identified to generally provide high-quality education, research, and service. The objectives are consistent with EC2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Following many department committees and Advisory Board meetings, the BME department established a set of Program Educational Objectives that focus on the expected accomplishments of the students in their careers. Afterwards, extensive meetings -overseen by a departmental committee and involving relevant parties including the student body, public healthcare institutions, private sector representatives, department alumni, and potential employers- preceded writing down the objectives in their final form and resulted in significant feedback from all those entities. The result of this process was the following Program Educational Objectives:</p><p id="Par38">PEO1.Visionary engineers and problem solvers, utilizing a breadth of scientific knowledge to address contemporary issues at the interface of engineering, medicine, and biology within a global, societal, and economic context.</p><p id="Par39">PEO2. Leaders in biotechnology and medical industries both in the public and private sector capable of serving national and regional industries, hospitals, and government agencies.</p><p id="Par40">PEO3. Ethically and socially conscious professional biomedical engineers functioning well in multi-disciplinary teams, effective in communicating ideas and technical information.</p><p id="Par41">PEO4. Independent learners who can master new knowledge and technologies, as well as, successfully engage in post-graduate studies and scientific research in engineering, medicine and biomedical sciences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Student Outcomes (SOs), Student Outcomes Related to Biomedicine (SOsM) and courses sub-outcomes</title><p id="Par42">Student Outcomes (SOs) were developed with participation of the BME program primary constituencies at the same time as the Program Educational Objectives. The SOs list includes the medical SOsM and the technical outcomes. The different committees believed that in order to establish the SOs that can ensure the achievement of the PEOs, students should be engaged in the five interrelated dimensions. The expected students&#8217; outcomes related to biomedicine (SOsM) have therefore been determined as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par43">The ability to function within multi-disciplinary teams including physicians and medical practitioners (dimensions: D2, D3 and D5).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Graduates must demonstrate adequate knowledge of physiology, anatomy, biology, and the capability of applying acquired skills to solve the problems specifically at the interface of medicine/biology and engineering (dimensions: D1, D3 and D4).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Graduates must demonstrate an ability to make measurements on, and interpret data from, living systems, addressing the problems associated with the medical and biological interaction between living and non-living materials and systems (dimensions: D1 and D3).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par46">The BME program primary constituencies felt the Student Outcomes (SOs) should directly support the Educational Objectives. The medical outcomes (SOsM) have therefore been determined in consistency with the program education objectives (PEOs), as illustrated in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The table shows a strong correlation between any given PEO and at least one of the SOsM. During the process of establishing the SOs, the following were also taken into consideration: the national, regional and global needs; ABET criteria; university, faculty of engineering, and BME department strategic plans; the feedback from health and biomedical institutions, alumni and advisory board through meetings; and the comments of students through interviews and other contacts.<table-wrap id="Tab1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Relationship of BME SOsM to Program Educational Objectives</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><th colspan="3" rowspan="1">BME student medical outcomes</th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">BME PEOs</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">1</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">2</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PEO1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#9633;</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#9632;</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#9632;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PEO2</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#9633;</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#9688;</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#9632;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PEO3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#9632;</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PEO4</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#9633;</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#9632;</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#9632;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The solid square presents the strongest correlation between a PEO and an SOM; the half square indicates a moderate relationship between a PEO and an SOM; the lowest level of correlation is presented by an empty square</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>

In developing a course syllabus, the course general outcomes are set first from the SOsM list. These outcomes for each course define the expected particular sub-outcomes. These may drastically differ from one course to another. This is the case because of the particular nature of each course. Once each course outcomes and sub-outcomes have been derived, the course is designed and delivered. Course assessment tools are then used to collect data indicating whether the course material has been properly delivered to the students. The proper delivery is indicated by the quantitative answers to the following questions: &#8220;to what extent should the course cover the outcome?&#8221;, &#8220;to what extent did the course actually cover the outcome by related activities?&#8221;, &#8220;to what extent did the course cover the outcome, from students&#8217; point of view?&#8221; and &#8220;to what extent did the students achieve the expected outcomes?&#8221;. The answers are found out using the indices presented in the next sub-sections:</p><p id="Par77">
<italic toggle="yes">&#8220;To what extent should the course address the outcome?&#8221; (Part 1).</italic>
</p><p id="Par78">Assessment of the Course by the Faculty (CAF): Each faculty evaluates each of the course intended outcomes 1, 2 and 3 on a scale 1&#8211;5. It is decided by the faculty member, teaching the course, and approved by the focus group and the BME department council. The evaluation corresponds to the extent the faculty feels the class should help the students achieve. Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> illustrates an example related to the course &#8220;Physiological modeling&#8221;. For example, if team work is not essential in the course (e.g. to be only considered in a mini project), it should be assigned a smaller weight compared to outcome 2 because the content focuses on anatomical/physiological concepts. Outcome 3 has smaller weight than outcome 2 as the interaction between human body and instrumentation is rather highlighted by other courses in the curriculum. The technical outcomes have the overall weight 5. The weight for every single technical outcome will be detailed in the next sub-section. The attribution of high weight to the technical outcomes is due to the fact that the course emphasizes several technical aspects: application of differential equations, analysis and validation of simulated data, design of a control system with its components, and the use of the engineering techniques in modeling issues. The scale 1&#8211;5 can be transformed to a percentage % scale by dividing the weight by the total.

</p><p id="Par80">Assessment of the Course by Student (CAS): Student assessments are surveys filled out at the end of each semester. These student assessments are intended to provide the students&#8217; views of their opportunities to master the students&#8217; outcomes. Not every class is expected to impact all students&#8217; outcomes. To minimize difficulty in filling the survey, the survey translates each course outcome, as presented in the course syllabus, into examples (course and lesson sub-outcomes) that are emphasized during teaching the course. The survey asks students to evaluate each course outcome based on a 1&#8211;5 scale, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent. The bases of evaluation should be on student&#8217;s feeling of how the course has helped him/her achieve the abilities, attributes, and skills as described in the outcomes. Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> illustrates an example about five sub-outcomes among the intended sub-outcomes of the course &#8220;Physiological modeling&#8221;. The first course sub-outcome is related to the student medical outcome 1.

The medical outcome 3 is assigned 10%.

The technical outcomes 3 and 10 have high weights because the course focuses on the design of control systems with static and dynamic properties and of mass transport processes as well as on the application of electrical and mechanical techniques to the several forms of simulation. On the other hand, technical outcomes 5, 7 and 8 got zero weights because the course does not target ethical, societal or life-long learning aspects. Moderate weights have been assigned to the technical outcomes 1, 2, 4, 6 and 9 because the course approaches moderately the experimental physiology, solving engineering problems, written and oral communication skills, and analysis of contemporary scientific articles about modeling.<table-wrap id="Tab4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>An example of <italic toggle="yes">Target</italic> percentages for SOsM in the course &#8216;Physiological modeling&#8217;</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The Instructor</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Dr. Enas Abdulhay</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The course (Name)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Physiological modeling</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The course (code)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">BME 531</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The number of credit hours</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Outcome</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Target</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Technical outcome 1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Technical outcome 2</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Technical outcome 3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Technical outcome 4</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Technical outcome 5</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Technical outcome 6</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Technical outcome 7</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Technical outcome 8</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Technical outcome 9</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Technical outcome 10</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medical outcome 1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medical outcome 2</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medical outcome 3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Total</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The medical outcome 2 has the highest weight since the course focuses on many aspects of physiology and physiological models.

The chosen weights (percentages) for curriculum, employer survey, training in healthcare centers, capstone course, exit survey, alumni survey, exit exam and course assessment by student are 30, 25, 10, 10, 10, 5, 5 and 5, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Targeted evaluation/improvement of curriculum medical content in light of quantitative assessment results</title><p id="Par120">The previous sections clearly showed a BME program has the 1&#8211;3 outcomes with varying values. Overall assessment indicates whether the weighted average of BME SOsM is a high, moderate or low success criterion. The improvement needed for the program is accordingly decided and specific actions should be taken in the curriculum to fill the gap. If the BME program achieves its targets in these key SOsM, this indicates that the BME curriculum is doing well in preparing the graduates from medical content point of view. Otherwise, the biomedical engineering curriculum committee is responsible for integrating changes into the curriculum. The changes are discussed and approved by the department council and advisory board. However, in the beginning of the continuous improvement process, the recommended changes -at the curriculum level- based on every assessment cycle are only adopted without application. After a number of assessment cycles, the changes are applied to the curriculum. Then, a new cycle of assessment begins. Only simple changes at course level (e.g. adding more examples to improve <italic toggle="yes">Tool</italic>) can be implemented immediately after an assessment cycle. This is due to the facts that, first, averaging over several assessment cycles eliminates irregularities or &#8220;noise&#8221; of values (out-of-trend values), second, the duration of a BME bachelor program is 5&#160;years; the changes should not therefore confuse the students already following a certain study plan.

The departmental council also studies the evaluation of the educational objectives and student outcomes made by the department&#8217;s constituents.

Course level assessment is the responsibility of the individual faculty teaching the specific course. At the end of each course &#8211;normally after the end of the semester- the faculty member provides a course assessment form or a course report that evaluates the course and addresses issues that need attention in the next time the course is taught. The assessment is done through measuring the achievements of stated outcomes based on the course assessment program and the course assessment by student discussed in previous sections. Focus groups that are usually formed, based on the area of expertise, review assessment results for the courses and make recommendations for improving the course e.g. improving the organization of the course. These proposed changes are submitted to the curriculum committee for subsequent approval by the department council. The information requested by the focus group to improve the process is the summary of faculty observations in the current semester as well as the new measures implemented at the beginning of the semester considering focus group earlier recommendations.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Targeted evaluation/improvement of curriculum medical content in light of quantitative assessment results</title><p id="Par133">A few adjustments have been made for the content of some courses in the Biomedical Engineering Program. For instance, the physiology course has been changed to &#8216;Physio-anatomy&#8217; to enforce living system knowledge. The main reason is the permanently low <italic toggle="yes">Score</italic> values related to the outcome 2, in the courses that necessitate anatomy knowledge (e.g. Biomechanics), despite all efforts made, at the course level, by the faculty members and focus groups (e.g. presenting introductory 3D videos that demonstrate anatomical concepts and asking the student to write a report). This is translated by the value 2.9 in Table <xref rid="Tab16" ref-type="table">16</xref>. Table <xref rid="Tab18" ref-type="table">18</xref> illustrates the result of the course assessment program applied to the Biomechanics course.

</p><p id="Par134">The second level of improvement lies in the curriculum development, which requires a comprehensive look at the courses taught, how they complement each other, and finally how they achieve SOsM. Based on the department recommendations, the 2% <italic toggle="yes">Target</italic> value (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) for outcome 1 should be slightly improved. Note that although the weighted average for outcome 1 is higher than 3, the assessment value given by the training supervisors is 2.7 (important assessment tool) (Table <xref rid="Tab16" ref-type="table">16</xref>). Consequently, new courses e.g. &#8216;Introduction to biomedical engineering&#8217; and &#8216;BME seminar&#8217; have been added to introduce students to multidisciplinary team/group work where they encounter situations with medical practitioners and students (outcome1) as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>. Furthermore, as far as the medical contemporary and cutting edge issues in BME are concerned, the <italic toggle="yes">Target</italic> values for outcomes 2 and 3, in the curriculum, should be adjusted accordingly. Thus, the program constituents recommended adding a number of core BME classes to tackle the evolution in biomedicine e.g. courses related to cell and molecules. A number of elective courses were also introduced in the curriculum e. g. Nanomedicine as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>.<fig id="Fig8" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>

</p><p id="Par135">The results also show a low value of <italic toggle="yes">Tool</italic> (compared to <italic toggle="yes">Target</italic>) for the SOsM in the BME courses taught by the pure technology departments and faculties at the university (e.g. Control systems). This is due to the fact that the courses lack activities that imply examples on applications of medical aspects. The improvement is achieved through incorporating those classes into the BME department (e.g. &#8220;Control and Communication in the Nervous System&#8221;, &#8220;Laboratory of Physiological Control&#8221;&#8230;etc.). This will add a medical component.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Identification of student outcomes related to biomedicine (SO<sc>s</sc>M)</title><p id="Par138">The present work serves as a guiding illustration to demonstrate a model of analysis since every BME curriculum has its own special elements and characteristics based on the institution&#8217;s goals. The proposed procedure can be generalized and hence used by any BME department. However, intended outcomes are subject to variability among universities. Consequently, SOsM stated above can be modified to adapt the analysis to every department mission, vision and objectives. Success criteria can also vary from one department to another. Departments focusing on biomaterials, artificial organs or neural aspects can attribute higher values to success criteria than those focusing on more technological issues.</p><p id="Par139">The followed outcome structure might appear different than the existing international medical outcome frameworks in the world; e.g. CanMEDS, ACGME outcomes, Scottish Doctor Outcomes. This is because the international medical learning outcome frameworks in medical education have at least five or more learning outcomes while the followed structure in the present work has three outcomes. For example the CanMEDS roles (physician competencies) are: Medical expert (the integrating role), communicator, collaborator, leader, health advocate, scholar and professional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The ACGME outcomes focus on patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning and improvement, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, and systems-based practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Scottish Doctor Outcomes focus on learning outcomes for clinical skills, practical procedures, patient investigation, patient management, communication, health promotion and disease prevention, medical informatics, social and clinical sciences and underlying principles, ethical understanding and legal responsibilities, decision making skills, clinical reasoning and judgment, role of the doctor within the health service, and personal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, if we examine carefully the applied outcome structure of the present work, we will find out that the dimensions (D1 to D5) and PEOs (PEO1 to PEO4) are almost similar to other internationally defined outcomes. Those dimensions and PEOs encompass not only the three medical skills and attributes but also the ABET technical outcomes (13 outcomes in overall). All outcomes complement each others to achieve the overall expected goals of the multidisciplinary BME curriculum, dimensions and PEOs. In addition, it is worthy to note the fact that the BME curriculum has a special-case medical content that is not supposed to target all the skills and the attributes (outcomes) expected from a medical student/doctor/physician in medicine; it is supposed to target the outcomes helping the BME students succeed in the medical field as future medical engineers. For example, a medical doctor/physician should be a good medical problem solver in medical diagnosis issues while a medical engineer should be a good technical problem solver in issues of application of engineering tools to medical diagnosis. The outcome of problem solving is therefore &#8216;dominated&#8217; by the technical side and hence considered as a technical outcome. Other examples are the objectives of leadership and decision making &#8216;dominated&#8217; by the technical side. Overall, the expected abilities will certainly not be underrepresented by the suggested structure (technical and medical outcomes altogether). Furthermore, the present work can be flexibly adapted to any other studied BME curriculum by interchanging a few outcomes between the lists of medical and technical outcomes based on the extent of &#8216;domination&#8217; as perceived by the curriculum objectives. However, at the end of process, the overall adapted structure should be verified in order to represent perfectly the aimed dimensions and PEOs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Separate quantitative assessment of every medical outcome SOsM by multiple quantitative assessment formats</title><p id="Par140">Many BM engineers are not confident of their medical knowledge. The difficulty is mainly produced by the weak medical content in the curriculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The proposed work is a promising approach that can solve the problem. The suggested assessment tools are useful for evaluation of BME students&#8217; expected capacity in the medical field. They are also helpful in cases of curricula addressing a mix of populations with medical and engineering backgrounds or interests.</p><p id="Par141">The presented quantitative approach has many advantages compared to the qualitative methods: validity (measures exactly the outcomes), generalizability, reliability (repeatable results) and objectivity (low bias) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the presented work, the methodology relies on more than one quantitative assessment tool to ensure high accuracy. Quantitative tools are very important for the evaluation of the multidisciplinary BME curriculum because the level considered as the &#8216;minimum expected level&#8217; for every medical outcome is a very sensitive parameter. For example, if a BME department offers a curriculum with two tracks: (1) biomedical instrumentation and (2) biomaterials and biomechanics then the students in both tracks are expected to demonstrate adequate knowledge of physiology. However, the minimum expected levels of &#8220;adequacy&#8221; are different. The difference can be simply detected by quantitative approaches (e.g. <italic toggle="yes">Target</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Score</italic> &#8230;etc.). Conversely, it is not easy to discover the difference by qualitative approach. In addition, the levels of &#8220;adequacy&#8221; of physiology knowledge, in both tracks, should not overcome the level of &#8220;adequacy&#8221; of the other medical or technical knowledge. However, the permitted extents of flexibility/tolerance in the tracks are dissimilar. It would be difficult to measure the tolerance by qualitative tools.</p><p id="Par142">In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the collaborators analyzed a number of qualitative surveys that helped them plan the improvement of the medical content in the BME department through building a relationship with medical schools. However, they did not measure the extent of improvement. The approach did not permit to quantify the precise difference between the curricula before and after. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the medical content has been improved by the problem-based integration of medical applications in engineering courses. Nevertheless, the study did not approach the effect on the whole curriculum structure and sequence. On the other hand, the research in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] which focused on the details of curriculum structure and development did not measure the impact on the students&#8217; outcomes and performance. It was rather interested in a program that can attract medical doctors and engineers, at the same time, without evaluating the level of medical knowledge for an engineer in comparison with another BME curriculum. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the BME curriculum is developed in consistency with the department&#8217;s clear-cut mission to realize courses with specific characteristics and rich in medical content. However, the assessment was only conducted by the survey of students&#8217; satisfaction. The authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] discussed the management, timeline and structure of a biomedical engineering based program organized for medical students. Yet, the program goals and expected progress are the only items investigated. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], a spiral approach has been conducted by revisiting of topics with increasing levels of difficulty/sophistication to enhance students&#8217; competency in medical and engineering fields. Conversely, the students&#8217; competency is measured with simple surveys and interviews. Finally, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the authors discussed the improvement of medical content of the BME curriculum by following the models in high standard international schools. The improvement is mainly carried out by adding appropriate elective courses. However, the interaction between the curriculum content and the level of student skills is not approached. In all of the previous mentioned studies, the medical outcomes are not clearly/separately identified or they are not precisely assessed; the assessments depend mainly on one type of survey/questionnaire or on students&#8217; overall grades. The present work shows that the clear identification of expected outcomes and the accurate assessment of achievement are strong tools of curriculum medical content evaluation/improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Targeted evaluation/improvement of curriculum medical content in light of quantitative assessment results</title><p id="Par143">In general, the present work is &#8220;user-friendly&#8221; so that it can be implemented smoothly in a continuous manner. However, the improvement of the courses can be tricky if the instructor does not map activities properly, does not give sufficient activities to cover the outcomes, or if he carries out the evaluation in a very general way. Errors in the improvement at the course level can induce cumulative errors in the curriculum level, which can affect the whole improvement procedure. Furthermore, as showed in the &#8216;Results&#8217; section, the individual assessments by every tool should not be neglected although the overall weighted average is calculated. The evaluation made by every assessment tool can give valuable information, especially the highly-weighted tools. For example, outcome 2 was attributed a value &gt;3 in overall assessment and a value slightly less than 3 in curriculum assessment. This was not ignored as shown in the previous section. In addition, outcome 1 was attributed a value &gt;3 in overall assessment and a value less than 3 by training supervisors. This was also taken into account.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par144">The degree of achievement of SOsM is an essential indicator for medical content in the BME program.
