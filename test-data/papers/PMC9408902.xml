Nanostructured scaffolds have been discovered to be more efficient for bone regeneration than macro/micro-sized scaffolds because they sufficiently permit cell adhesion, proliferation, and chemical transformation. Nanofibrous scaffolds mimicking artificial extracellular matrices provide a natural environment for tissue regeneration owing to their large surface area, high porosity, and appreciable drug loading capacity. Here, we review recent progress and possible future prospective electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds have demonstrated promising potential in bone tissue regeneration using a variety of nanomaterials. This review focused on the crucial role of electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds in biological applications, including drug/growth factor delivery to bone tissue regeneration. Natural and synthetic polymeric nanofibrous scaffolds are extensively inspected to regenerate bone tissue. We focused mainly on the significant impact of nanofibrous composite scaffolds on cell adhesion and function, and different composites of organic/inorganic nanoparticles with nanofiber scaffolds. This analysis provides an overview of nanofibrous scaffold-based bone regeneration strategies; however, the same concepts can be applied to other organ and tissue regeneration tactics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bone tissue regeneration</kwd><kwd>nanofibrous scaffolds</kwd><kwd>electrospinning</kwd><kwd>nanofiber composite</kwd><kwd>bone defects</kwd><kwd>growth factor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</funding-source><award-id>2020YFF0426289</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Sichuan Science and Technology Program</funding-source><award-id>2020YFH0008</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Key R&amp;D Program of China (no. 2020YFF0426289) and the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (no. 2020YFH0008).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-23-09206"><title>1. Introduction</title><sec id="sec1dot1-ijms-23-09206"><title>1.1. Bone Defect&#8212;Challenges and Current Treatment</title><p>Since the advent of living species until now, different kinds of disorders, diseases, and infections have been faced by human beings. Among them, bone-related disorders have a major influence on the population worldwide. The reconstruction and healing of body tissues and organs are substantial obstacles for physicians and tissue engineers. The increased incidence of tissue injury and organ damage has increased the requirement for organ transplantation year after year. Bone is the most often transplanted tissue after blood [<xref rid="B1-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many studies revealed that bone regeneration is one of the most complicated issues. Notably, bone defects or dysfunction affect approximately 20 million people annually related to different kinds of bone-related disorders, namely, congenital anomalies, trauma, or another disease [<xref rid="B1-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Bone grafts or bone replacements are used in an estimated 2.2 million surgeries annually [<xref rid="B3-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Bone serves various functions, including primary backing structure, binding position for tendons, ligaments and muscles, mechanical strength, and protection of vital tissues and organs. The bone marrow structure also provides hematopoiesis and essential mineral materials [<xref rid="B5-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis, bone cancer, and bone infection have become a significant concern for modern communities as the prevalence of these diseases has increased [<xref rid="B7-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Most of the bone fractures are caused by inconvenient or ineffective bone tissue restoration. While bone tissue has an excellent capability for regeneration, significant bone deficiencies caused by tumor removal, cancer, contagious illness, extreme mechanical damage, and inherited abnormalities do not heal on their own and necessitate extensive bone grafting [<xref rid="B8-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In orthopedic and reconstructive surgery, bone is one of the most often transplanted tissues.</p><p>Bone fracture regeneration is a multistep, organized process involving many progenitor cells and endothelial, inflammatory and hematopoietic cells [<xref rid="B9-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Osteoprogenitor cells are the primary bone cells that can differentiate into mature bone cells and can be activated and converted into osteoblasts during bone damage and repair. Proliferation, matrix maturation and mineralization are the three stages of osteogenic differentiation that permit osteoblasts to develop new bones [<xref rid="B10-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The bone regeneration process involves three steps: inflammation, bone development, and bone remodeling (<xref rid="ijms-23-09206-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B12-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. When a bone is fractured, it starts bleeding into the surrounding area, which causes inflammation and blood clotting at the fracture site. This is the primary source of fundamental strength and the foundation for new bone growth. Bone formation begins when inflammation-induced blood clots are replaced by stringy tissue and cartilage (acknowledged as a soft callus). Hard bone (known as a hard callus) replaces the soft callus once it regenerates, which can be seen on X-rays a few weeks after the injury. Bone remodeling, the last step of bone repair, will take months to complete [<xref rid="B13-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Current medical treatment approaches to bone repair comprise allogeneic (grafts derived from some other member of the same species; normally cadaveric bone collected from a bone bank) or autologous (transfer of bone grafts from a donor to a recipient located in the same patient) bone grafts. Autologous bone grafting remains the gold standard due to its optimal osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic properties. On the other hand, these replacements have certain disadvantages, such as the chance of immunological failure and the transfer of pathogen through source towards the recipient, donor scarcity, and high cost [<xref rid="B15-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For these issues, a better effective clinical therapy strategy is needed. Tissue engineering is a cutting-edge medical technique that has produced remarkable achievements in reducing the risks associated with numerous surgical procedures. Therefore, bone tissue engineering requires therapeutic treatment for damaged bones and eliminates the risk of donor inadequacy, supply constraints, and immunological refusal [<xref rid="B17-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Bone tissue engineering (BTE) procedures make usage of various scaffolds (e.g., composite scaffolds, nanofibrous scaffolds, porous scaffolds, hydrogel scaffolds) in conjunction with biological materials. The development of a bio-artificial bone graft, a scaffold that replicates extracellular matrix (ECM) while also having osteoconductive functionality that may be used to restore broken or damaged bones, is a major problem in BTE. To address the demand for successful bone tissue regeneration (BTR), a method for developing biomaterials, including nanosized topographical design, micro- and macro-scale graded geometries and biological arenas that combine with specific growth factors (GFs) and cells, is required [<xref rid="B18-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The intrinsic porosity of the bone tissue scaffold is an important characteristic that permits vast numbers of osteogenic cells to integrate and develop tissues. A structure having significant porosity, linked pores, and a wide surface area has been shown to promote tissue in-growth [<xref rid="B20-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Scaffolds can stimulate bone regeneration and disintegrate over time or provide a lifelong substitute, which is the more advanced measure to bridge the bone defect as an alternative to traditional methods of bone grafting. Besides natural and artificial bone grafting for BTR, modern surgical methods also employ drug/GF-loaded scaffolds. To augment the therapeutic efficiency of bone regeneration, several biodegradable natural and artificial polymer-based drug delivery arrangements have been developed and tested in in vivo and in vitro studies [<xref rid="B21-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>One of the critical problems in BTE is the creation of scaffolds with outstanding mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, and designs for cell growth and migration that might allow the scaffold&#8217;s interface with the host tissue. Bone tissue engineers are now exploring several options in this area, formulating novel structures using a comprehensive set of biomaterials and cell therapy to boost bone and joint health. Once inside the body, ideal scaffolds should retain adequate mechanical properties, degrade in a regulated manner without disarranging toxic materials, regulate the release of loaded drugs or biomolecules in a time and space-controlled manner, and direct cell activity to replicate the hierarchical architecture of primitive bone tissue.</p><p>The electrospinning technique to create these scaffolds has gained tremendous interest because the nanofibers are biomimetic of the ECM in natural bone, which entails mainly hierarchically structured, mineralized collagen fibers, as well as simple setup and operation at low cost [<xref rid="B23-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The electrospinning process is appealing for tissue engineering, drug delivery, and other biomedical uses due to its ease of use and high surface-to-volume ratio (<xref rid="ijms-23-09206-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Nanostructured particles, including nanofibrous scaffolds, have been extensively researched to improve the current treatment method&#8217;s effectiveness and specificity.</p><p>The latest progress made in the field of electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds for BTR is summarized in <xref rid="ijms-23-09206-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-ijms-23-09206"><title>1.2. Biology of Bones</title><p>Bones comprise a group of tissues in the human body with a complex hierarchically arranged structure from the nano (collagen and hydroxyapatite) to the macro (cancellous and cortical bone) scale (<xref rid="ijms-23-09206-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref rid="B30-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The hard outer layer of bone is cortical bone, which consists of Haversian canals and osteons, while the inside structure (spongy bone) has a trabecular arrangement with a porosity of 75&#8211;85% [<xref rid="B32-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The surface of bones consists of a complicated arrangement of parallel type I collagen nanofibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals. The bone matrix comprises approximately 10% water, 25% organic, and 65% mineral components. Collagen type I (90%) and type V (in minor amounts) are the most abundant proteins in the organic matrix, with non-collagenous proteins including phospholipids, osteonectin, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and fibronectin contributing to the remaining 10% [<xref rid="B33-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The mechanical strength and tissue adhesive properties of bone matrix proteins are crucial. With bicarbonates, citrates, and ions such as F<sup>&#8722;</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Sr<sup>2+</sup>, hydroxyapatite (HA) [Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>] is the most essential element of the inorganic mineral phase of bone [<xref rid="B35-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The basic multicellular unit (BMU) comprises the four primary essential cells involved in bone structure and regeneration: osteogenic, osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts [<xref rid="B37-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Osteoblasts are mesenchymal-derived osteoprogenitor cells in the bone marrow and other connective tissues. Osteoblasts secrete type I collagen and a variety of non-collagenous proteins, including osteopontin, osteocalcin, phospholipids, and bone sialoprotein, during the ossification phase. These cells are in control of bone growth and remodeling [<xref rid="B10-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Osteocytes are the most prevalent cell type found in bone tissue. MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) that have undergone osteoblastic differentiation produce osteocytes. These osteoblasts are no longer active and become stuck in the bone they formed. They keep in touch with other osteoblasts and osteocytes. They are required for the interaction of bone tissue. Moreover, osteocytes were found to interact with various bio-chemical signaling pathways and play a role in controlling calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Bone brittleness is caused by osteocyte cell growth failure, leading to osteoporosis [<xref rid="B40-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Osteoclasts are multinucleated, large cells that are distinct from the hematopoietic lineage. They produce enzymes and acids that solubilize and digest minerals in the bones, and this process is referred to as resorption. Osteoclasts aid in the remodeling of damaged bones and developing pathways for blood vessels and nerves to pass through. Osteoporosis (increased osteoclast activity) and osteopetrosis (increased osteoclastic activity) are diseases marked by irregularities in osteoclastic activity [<xref rid="B42-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Scaffolds, unlike permanent implants, are designed to offer temporary support for cell adherence. Scaffolds are able to replicate the complicated fibrillar design of natural ECM constituents and transport bioactive chemicals that stimulate tissue regeneration. Biomimetic scaffolds create a synthetic osteogenic milieu that aids ossification and improves therapeutic outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-23-09206"><title>2. Nanofibrous Scaffold</title><p>A scaffold is an important element in tissue engineering for bone regeneration because it functions as a prototype for cell interactions and the development of bone extracellular matrix to offer structural support to newly produced tissue. Scaffolds are generally made up of a strong support structure coupled with a pore network. It must allow cells to colonize, proliferate, differentiate, and migrate. It should also have the requisite physicochemical qualities (such as strength, stiffness, biodegradability, and surface chemistry) for tissue development and the ability to tolerate and respond to mechanical stressors [<xref rid="B44-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Natural bone has a one-of-a-kind mix of mechanical qualities due to an architectural design that spans nanoscale to macroscopic dimensions, with precisely and meticulously designed interfaces. Bone&#8217;s lightweight strength is due to the composite structure of mineralized collagen nanofibrils. The mineralized collagen fibrils subsequently align and organize in various ways to generate higher order structures and, finally, a complete bone [<xref rid="B45-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. With the capacity to create nanofibrous structures, a race has begun to replicate the ECM and create scaffolds that are an artificial extracellular matrix suited for tissue creation. Nanosized scaffolds were naturally created to resemble these nanofibrous collagen (a natural ECM). Nanofibrous scaffolds have fiber sizes that are similar to collagen fiber bundles, ranging between 50 and 500 nanometers [<xref rid="B46-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. By combining entirely regulated complex interconnected pore patterns and striving to emulate the 3D structure of natural collagen matrix, nanofibrous scaffolds address challenges of mass transfer (signaling molecules, nutrients, and metabolic waste movement) and spatial cellular organization (cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;matrix interactions). Furthermore, by employing a synthetic fibrillar matrix, these nanofibrous scaffolds eliminate the risk of immunogenicity and disease transmission [<xref rid="B47-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, surface, mechanical compatibility, and osteocompatibility are issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Nanofibrous scaffolds have played a key role in biomedical research covering drug delivery to tissue regeneration because of their large surface area and the ability to control their characteristics by modifying formulation and fabrication parameters [<xref rid="B48-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Nanofibrous scaffolds have different surface properties than standard or microstructured materials because of their substantially increased surface area and roughness and their dimensional resemblance to bone/cartilage tissue (such as wettability, surface energy, surface topography, and chemistry) [<xref rid="B50-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The literature revealed that nanostructure scaffolds with cell-friendly surface properties facilitate more complex protein interaction.

The scaffolds were inserted in critical-size rat calvarial bone defects. Nanofibrous scaffolds promoted significantly more new bone tissue development than solid-wall scaffolds, as evidenced by Von Kossa staining and micro-computed tomography measurements. Collagen deposition in nanofibrous scaffolds was confirmed by Goldner&#8217;s trichrome staining, but not in solid-wall scaffolds. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) and Runx2 were highly immunostained in the cells in these scaffolds. Trichrome, Runx2, and BSP were only weakly stained in solid-wall scaffolds implanted in the defects.

Composition and Structure of Nanofibrous Scaffold</title><p>Scaffold architecture (such as porosity) can deliver adequate microenvironments for vascularization, cell migration, differentiation, proliferation, angiogenesis, and nutrient/waste exchange during bone regeneration. The hierarchical design of bone tissue is made up of nano-blocks (such as HA nanocrystals and type I collagen nanofibers). According to a recent study, different dimensional levels of nanostructures may have diverse functions in bone regeneration regulation. Nanofibers (2D level) can influence stem cell differentiation by altering cellular mechanotransduction mode and/or intracellular signaling in an indirect manner. Nano-featured surfaces have a larger surface area, which increases both protein and cell adhesion in bone regeneration. Increased protein absorption may result in more interfacial contacts among cells and substrates, most likely via integrin-mediated signaling pathways that influence cell activity (such as cell attachment, spreading, development, and osteogeneous differentiation) [<xref rid="B58-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

Electrospinning: Method of Nanofiber Scaffold Fabrication</title><p>Electrospinning is a fast and efficient way to make nanofibers from natural and man-made polymers such as gelatin, cellulose, collagen, PVA, etc. In the 1930s, Anton Formhals laid the groundwork for the electrospinning process, which revived as a popular issue in the 1990s. Several research groups proved in the early 1990s that several organic macromolecules could be electrospun in the form of nanofibers [<xref rid="B78-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. A high voltage is used in a traditional electrospinning process to generate an electro-charge jet of molten/solution of polymer, which hardens on extrusion and forms a polymeric fiber. The three essential components of electrospinning setup/machine are a source of high-voltage power, a spinneret attached to a syringe/capillary tube (to deliver polymer solution), and a collector (<xref rid="ijms-23-09206-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A) [<xref rid="B79-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In a typical electrospinning arrangement, the spinneret is connected to a syringe containing polymer solution. Using a syringe pump, the solution can be charged at a consistent pace through the spinneret. An electric field is created among a counter electrode and a positively charged spinneret filled with a polymer solution in a conventional electrospinning setup. When a high voltage is supplied, the suspended drop of polymer solution at the spinneret&#8217;s nozzle is dynamically charged and the stimulated charges are uniformly spread throughout the whole surface. At equilibrium, the droplet&#8217;s surface tension would normally evolve into a spherical. The concentration of charge may cause a projection to form on the droplet&#8217;s end, reshaping it into a cone termed the Taylor cone. With a further rise in field strength, the electrostatic repulsion outweighs the surface tension, ejecting a charged jet of polymeric solution from the Taylor cone point once a critical level is reached. The polymeric solution is discharged as a jet, which then goes through a lengthening and twisting process, resulting in a long thin thread, which is finally gathered on a stationary or spinning grounded metallic collector. Two main electrospinning parameters greatly influence the fiber creation and structure: system parameters and processing parameters [<xref rid="B81-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].

The collector type employed is a significant factor that may influence the architecture of the collected fibers. A basic collector plate will create an unraveling mat structure of fibers in a different alignment, while some collectors can gather oriented fibers. The rotational speed of generalized collectors such as spinning discs, drums, and mandrels is a crucial component that can impact the rate of fiber deposition. When a fiber connects to a collector and is pulled out of the collection, the fibers will extend or break into little segments if the collector moves faster than the fibers [<xref rid="B82-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Co-axial or multi-axial electrospinning uses additional spinnerets for producing core-shell-type nanofibers compared to conventional techniques (<xref rid="ijms-23-09206-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). The co-axial arrangement consists of two spinnerets: an inner-core spinneret that is symmetrically wrapped around the outermost shell of a spinneret. After two polymeric solutions are concurrently introduced, a core-shell-type droplet is formed at the output of the interior and exterior nozzles. Core-shell nanofibers have been created with remarkable accuracy by using suitable solution concentrations. Polymers [<xref rid="B83-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], biomolecules [<xref rid="B84-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], proteins [<xref rid="B85-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], and inorganic compounds [<xref rid="B86-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] may all be restrained into the core element of core-shell-type nanofibers through co-axial electrospinning.

Melt electrospinning has the potency to be exploited in BTE when solvent extraction and toxicity are challenges.

Growth Factor-Dependent Nanofibrous Scaffold for Bone Tissue Regeneration</title><p>The universal aim for BTE exists in creating a scaffold that functions identically to natural ECM, which can be accomplished by adding factor GF or modifying nanofibers. The three chief modules of tissue engineering are stem cells, biomaterials, and GFs. GF delivery plays a vital function in tissue redevelopment and GFs are being used in new clinical policies to improve the healing of broken bones, limit disproportionate bone development, and hasten the curing process, and they usually advance the distribution of therapeutics [<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These factors facilitate the migration of progenitors and inflammatory cells to commence the healing process in a bone regeneration environment by diffusing signals at the defect site through the ECM. As a result, adding GFs to the scaffold biomaterial is expected to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis while also controlling excessive bone growth and speeding up the healing process. According to their structural and evolutionary properties, GFs can be divided into numerous families. Some of the GFs addressed in the present review for BTE purposes are BMP (bone morphogenetic protein), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), TGF-&#946; (transforming growth factor), PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), and FGF (fibroblast growth factor). Each of these GFs has a distinct role to perform in bone repair. Co-axial electrospinning/emulsion electrospinning, layer-by-layer (LBL) multilayer assemblage, physical adsorption/encapsulation, enclosed in micro/nanosphere and chemical deposition via photo-immobilization, click chemistry, and plasma treatment are the five procedures for loading GFs on nanofiber scaffolds [<xref rid="B112-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. GFs are signaling polypeptides or proteins, which are released soluble. These GFs govern undistinguishable cell proliferation and differentiation by binding to their explicit transmembrane receptors and conveying intracellular signals to increase or decrease particular cell functions. GFs are commonly employed in the human body to activate endogenous proteins which stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref rid="B213-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. The TGF-&#946; series includes GFs and BMPs, which impact cellular activity, growth, differentiation, and ECM production in a variety of cells. Twenty BMPs, including BMP-2/-4/-5/-6/-7, have been identified as being involved in osteogenic differentiation and efficiently endorse the differentiation of BMSCs hooked on osteoblasts and encourage bone formation; among them, BMP-2 and BMP-7 have attracted a lot of attention, and have been integrated in FDA-approved bone regeneration devices [<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B214-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>]. BMP-2 is a bone-promoting GF with a nanosize of 7 &#215; 3.5 &#215; 3 nm<sup>3</sup>. BMP signaling is believed to be involved in a large number of cellular functions, with canonical signaling transduction by BMPs occurring via both Smad-dependent and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways. BMP regulates osteogenic activity, which has been found to enhance transcription of osteogenic marker genes such as Runx2. Notwithstanding their excellent potency, recombinant BMPs have several issues with their clinical application due to their short life and rapid clearance by body fluids. Since proteins injected into the affected site lose their biological function over a certain amount of time, to accomplish adequate bone regeneration, large dosages of recombinant BMPs are employed in medical research. The large amount and multiple administrations of BMP-2 might cause undesirable systematic side effects. To avoid these issues, drug delivery systems must be developed to safely regulate their biological activity for a prolonged period, prevent destruction, and monitor their slow release to the intended location [<xref rid="B215-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. Kim et al. created PCL/Gel/BCP (biphasic calcium phosphate) scaffolds loaded with BMP-2, and the discharge of BMP-2 was shown to contribute to initial bone development [<xref rid="B216-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>].</p><p>PDGF, which is released by platelets at the area of fracture all through initial tissue regeneration, is a messenger protein that, like BMPs, plays a crucial role in bone healing. There are multiple isoforms comprising PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, PDGF-AB, PDGF-CC, and PDGF-DD. Among them, PDGF-BB, which can attach to every isoform of the PDGF receptor, is regarded as the universal GF in this family. The inclusion of PDGF-BB into nanofibrous scaffolds was found to be beneficial in enhancing bone cell proliferation and mesenchymal cell migration concurrently in various studies [<xref rid="B107-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In an in vitro study, Raghavendran and other co-authors found that PDGF-BB functions synergistically with biomaterials such as PLLA/Col/HAp as well as PLLA/HAp to increase the potential of osteogenic differentiation. As a result, this combination can be employed to regenerate bone tissue [<xref rid="B217-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>].</p><p>Other GFs are FGF-1 and FGF-2, which are the most reported GFs during regeneration of bone, which induces angiogenesis by enhancing callus development and osteoblast cells. It has been reported that specifically, FGF-2 signaling peptides implicated a strong angiogenetic action, increasing the number of osteoblasts and chondroblasts, resulting in bone regeneration [<xref rid="B218-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>,<xref rid="B219-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>,<xref rid="B220-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. Rubert M. et al. successfully fabricated PCL/PEO coaxial fibers containing FGF-2, which displayed long-term release, and established its capacity to increase fibroblast cell survival and proliferation [<xref rid="B221-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>].</p><p>VEGF is an essential cofactor of angiogenesis in bone growth, particularly VEGF levels peaking in the days after a bone fracture. It is a signal protein and is essential for the propagation, relocation, and instigation of the endothelial cells such as paracrine factors. Moreover, its bioactivity endorses angiogenesis, cell differentiation, and chemotactic activity. Because of its capacity to stimulate neovascularization (angiogenesis) and improving bone vascularity, VEGF is of particular interest. Furthermore, it is vital in the enhancement of blood vessel permeability and fenestration [<xref rid="B60-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B222-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. In mouse femur fractures, VEGF can improve blood vessel production, ossification, and new bone (callus) maturation, as well as increase bony bridging of a rabbit radius segmental gap defect. Rosa and co-workers demonstrated that scaffolds made of PLGA/BSA/VEGF increased cell adherence and were innocuous to cells [<xref rid="B223-ijms-23-09206" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. <xref rid="ijms-23-09206-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> contains an overview of the literature reviewed in this section.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec10-ijms-23-09206"><title>10. Conclusions and Future Prospects</title><p>Complex bone fractures produced by a variety of traumas and diseases require intervention. Autografts are still the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; in orthopedics due to their effectiveness and biocompatibility, but they are in short supply. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to develop alternatives for bone healing which are safe, cost effective, and show rapid bone repair. Tissue engineering is a new interdisciplinary research area to restore or improve tissue structure, and it can significantly raise the quality of human life. Scaffolds used in tissue repair should have a chemical composition and physical structure similar to native ECM. Blood vessels deliver nutrients, oxygen, and neurogenic GFs to stimulate neurogenesis, whereas nerve fibers deliver vascular neuropeptides in a common pathway to enhance angiogenesis, ultimately promoting bone development and repair in a synergistic manner. The osteogenesis and neurogenesis of hBMSCs are influenced by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Increased neurogenesis may be a way for BDNF to indirectly enhance osteogenesis. This review chiefly engrosses the fundamentals of nanofibrous scaffolds for BTR to provide investigators with a universal understanding of their potential applications in BTE. Natural and semisynthetic polymers are popular because of their biodegradability and simplicity of production, such as PLGA, PGA, PLA, PLLA, CS, Gel, and Col, known as exceptional contenders for biomimetic scaffolds for BTR uses. Electrospinning is one of the most suitable and reliable techniques to create nanoporous or nanofibrous scaffolds for biomedical purposes. The biomimetic composition, osteoconductivity, and mechanical strength of organic/inorganic nanoparticles were used to create composite scaffolds. Bone structure varies from macro to nano scale. Therefore, nanocomposites primarily consist of nano- and micro-scale components that perform macro-scale functions at the tissue level. Further research focuses on designing composite nanofibrous scaffolds based on the nanofibrous morphology of native collagen. Calcium carbonates and bioactive glass nanoparticles can now be added to the list of potentially relevant mineral elements, previously confined to HAP and TCP found in natural bone tissue. Nanofibrous composite scaffolds can remain as the basis for BTE because of their biomimetic qualities. GFs or proteins may be loaded into biomimetic scaffolds to enhance cell adhesion, cell differentiation, and tissue regeneration. The mechanical strength of electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds must be enhanced for biomaterials scaffolds as structural support to match new tissue creation. The ideal alignment of nanofibers is of great importance to mimic the structure of native tissues. With the use of electrospun nanofibers, bioactive molecules could be delivered on-site without suffering any loss in their activities or structures. The high porosity of electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds allows for the controlled release of the loaded bioactive molecules in therapeutic doses. Although there are certain drawbacks to this method in clinical applications, including limited cellular penetration, high fiber density, and potential solvent/crosslinker toxicity, these issues can be resolved using techniques such as electrospinning polymers and cells, reducing the density of fibers and increasing the width of pores. Ultimately, the further development of electrospinning and electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds must address a number of issues, including the incompatibility of material degradation and bone development rates, the inability to provide numerous growth factors, and the dearth of a cohesive network of new bone and blood arteries. Due to their biomimetic nature, nanofibrous scaffolds may be the cornerstone as the BTE field aims to be able to totally and effectively repair bone defects. There is still considerable work ahead because full regeneration has not been achieved, despite the advances, biomimicry, and efficient drug delivery offered by electrospun nanofibers. The integration of a programmable delivery system into nanofiber-based regenerative scaffolds will be a future strategy for dealing with this specific problem, and this will open up fascinating new possibilities for tissue regeneration. Employing nanofiber potential for varied degrees of stiffness and drug loading will enable the creation of nanostructured scaffolds with appropriate spatial and temporal control. The integration and refinement of electrospinning technologies may be a game changer for biomaterial-based scaffold design and approaches to successful tissue regeneration.</p><p>As a result, future therapies for bone problems will need to take a comprehensive approach.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>S.A., F.R. and D.K.A. performed the literature retrieval and prepared the draft.
