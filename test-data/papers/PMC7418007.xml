In stage 2, we reviewed videos on YouTube, focusing on the experiences of current or former contraceptive implant users (as these implants are similar to those in development in SLAP-HIV). In stage 3, individuals who indicated use of a subdermal implant for contraception in the last 5 years were recruited via a web-based questionnaire. Eligible participants (n=12 individuals who liked implants a lot and n=12 individuals who disliked implants a lot) completed in-depth phone interviews (IDIs) about their experiences. In stage 4, results from IDIs were used to develop a web-based survey for HIV-negative GBM to rate their likelihood of using a PrEP implant on a scale (1=very unlikely and 5=very likely) based on likely device characteristics and implant concerns identified in the IDIs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the scientific literature review (stage 1), concerns about contraceptive implants that could apply to the PrEP implants in development included potential side effects (eg, headache), anticipated high cost of the device, misconceptions about PrEP implants (eg, specific contraindications), and difficulty accessing PrEP implants. In the stage 2 YouTube review, individuals who had used contraceptive implants reported mild side effects related to their device. In stage 3, implant users reported that devices were comfortable, unintrusive, and presented only minor discomfort (eg, bruising) before or after insertion and removal. They mainly reported removing or disliking the device due to contraceptive-related side effects (eg, prolonged menstruation). Participants in the stage 4 quantitative survey (N=304) were mainly gay (204/238, 85.7%), white (125/238, 52.5%), cisgender men (231/238, 97.1%), and 42.0% (73/174) of them were on oral PrEP. Not having to take a daily pill increased the likelihood of using PrEP implants (mean 4.13). Requiring &gt;1 device to achieve 1 year of protection (mean range 1.79-2.94) mildly discouraged PrEP implant use. Participants did not mind moderate bruising, a small scar, tenderness, or bleeding after insertion or removal, and an implant with a size slightly larger than a matchstick (mean ratings 3.18-3.69).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PrEP implants are promising among GBM.

A total of two trials are currently investigating subdermal implants for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): (1) the Sustained Long-Acting Prevention against HIV (SLAP-HIV) trial (preclinical phases) [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and (2) Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa-018 (phase I or II) [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Little is known about whether such HIV prevention devices would be acceptable or feasible for end users [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is a concern given that uptake of existing PrEP products (eg, oral PrEP) is suboptimal in some key populations who are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. For example, in a 2017 cohort study of 995 gay and bisexual men (GBM) across the United States, only 4% of participants reported currently using oral PrEP [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The reasons for this limited uptake are continually emerging [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Involving potential consumers in the initial stages of product development could help mitigate later issues with method use. Specifically, early consumer involvement could help researchers understand end users&#8217; anticipated challenges with uptake and adherence, allowing them to address and potentially limit these problems in the design of clinical tools [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>SLAP-HIV is an interdisciplinary research project that aims to identify, develop, and test a long-acting PrEP implant. A proposed version of this product could be inserted under the skin of a user&#8217;s upper arm. This device is conceptualized to slowly dispense a single HIV prevention medication (such as tenofovir alafenamide or cabotegravir) over a period (eg, 2-12 months). Similar devices are currently used by cisgender women (ie, individuals who were assigned female at birth and identify as women) to dispense contraceptive medication (eg, Nexplanon) [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, it is possible to learn from the experiences of current and past users of an implant similar to the one in development to understand their likes and dislikes about this mode of drug delivery.</p><p>This study was undertaken as part of SLAP-HIV. We aimed to identify barriers and facilitators anticipated by GBM who might use PrEP implants in the future. Although the end goal of this work focused on the opinions of GBM, we focused on cisgender women during the initial stages, as the contraceptive implant is the product most similar to the one in development by SLAP-HIV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This work was completed in 4 stages, which are summarized below.</p><sec><title>Stage 1: Scientific Literature Review</title><p>We conducted a review of the scientific literature on publicly available (eg, Google Scholar and PubMed) and university-specific (eg, Columbia University libraries) databases to identify barriers and facilitators of contraceptive implant use among cisgender women. We focused our review on contraceptive implants, as this device is most similar to the one in development by SLAP-HIV. Furthermore, there is extremely limited data on cisgender men&#8217;s experiences with implants to deliver gender-specific medications (eg, the Testopel testosterone implant); these implants also operate differently than those under study in SLAP-HIV (eg, Testopel is a nonremoveable biodegradable pellet implant) [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We limited our search to studies published in the last 10 years (January 1998 to July 2017). Search terms included &#8220;contraceptive implant barriers,&#8221; &#8220;contraceptive implant removal,&#8221; &#8220;contraceptive implant facilitators,&#8221; &#8220;contraceptive implant experiences,&#8221; and &#8220;contraceptive implant continuation.&#8221; We limited the search to studies published about US populations and manuscripts on arm-implant contraceptives (eg, studies focused only on intrauterine devices [IUDs] were excluded).</p><p>The primary author (CR) and a research assistant (CL) abstracted relevant studies and independently reviewed their full content to determine their applicability to the topic under study (eg, device-related barriers and facilitators to contraceptive implants). CR and CL met in person to discuss the results of the independent reviews, resolve a disagreement about study relevance in concert, and identify studies to move forward with. After the studies to be included in the final review were identified, CR tallied the specific mention of device-related and contraceptive medication&#8722;related barriers and facilitators in a word document. There was very little mention in the scientific literature about the device-related effects of contraceptive implants. Thus, stage 2 (summarized below) intended to learn more about users&#8217; device-related subdermal implant experiences, as this will be important for our target population, GBM (stage 4).</p></sec><sec><title>Stage 2: Review of YouTube Videos</title><p>A total of 2 members of the research team identified a collection of potentially relevant YouTube videos through a manual search. Search terms included lay and commercial names of contraceptives: &#8220;Nexplanon,&#8221; &#8220;Nexplanon insertion,&#8221; &#8220;Jadelle,&#8221; &#8220;Jadelle implant,&#8221; &#8220;Nexplanon birth control,&#8221; &#8220;Norplant,&#8221; &#8220;Implanon,&#8221; &#8220;Implanon birth control review,&#8221; and &#8220;Arm bar birth control.&#8221; We excluded sponsored testimonials, insertion or removal footage that included no assessment of the patient&#8217;s experience, clinical videos (ie, procedural videos on how to insert or remove implants), promotional or educational videos (ie, videos explaining what contraceptive implants are or how they work), and advertisements for any product. Then, spoken word transcripts of potentially relevant videos were automatically generated using YouTube&#8217;s state-of-the-art speech recognition algorithms [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>To identify biomedical terms in YouTube transcripts, we used a publicly available natural language processing system called National Center for Biomedical Ontology Annotator, maintained by the National Library of Medicine [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The system recognizes sets of words and phrases using string matching and regular expressions that operate directly on text without preprocessing, such as spelling correction, part-of-speech tagging, and word sense disambiguation [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To identify the various side effects associated with subdermal implants, we utilized Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a comprehensive terminology that provided term-to-concept mapping for a vast array of conditions, symptoms, and clinical findings.</p><p>We restricted our search to several types of concepts or <italic toggle="yes">semantic types.</italic> We identified relevant semantic types by using SNOMED to annotate a string of words typically associated with unpleasant experiences with drug delivery implants. We then reported the frequency of the specific terms describing these unpleasant experiences (eg, contusion and pain). Terms were paired to ensure clarity in the themes to which they were intended to refer (eg, bleeding, menstrual spotting). We then quantified the frequency (eg, number of videos) with which they appeared.</p></sec><sec><title>Stage 3: In-Depth Interviews With Contraceptive Implant Users</title><p>In stage 3, we recruited potential participants using paid Facebook advertisements and posts on contraceptive implant-themed Facebook pages (eg, <italic toggle="yes">Nexplanon</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Implanon</italic>) and other female-centered Facebook groups (eg, <italic toggle="yes">Girls Love Travel</italic>), with permission from page moderators. We exclusively sampled cisgender women in this stage because we wanted to ensure that the implant participants had used a design that was consistent with those of the PrEP implants in the development pipeline. Subdermal implants commonly available to men (eg, Testopel testosterone pellets, which are a nonremovable pellet implant, placed in the gluteal region) have a much different design [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This sampling approach had 2 purposes as it would allow (1) PrEP implant developers to incorporate feedback from past or current users of a similar implant into their device design and (2) the research team to be more precise about the questions asked to potential future PrEP implant users in the stage 4 web-based survey.</p><p>Participants were invited to click on a link that took them to a brief screening questionnaire to assess eligibility for telephone interviews about their experiences with implants. Eligible participants were at least 18 years old, identified as cisgender women, and had used an implant for contraception in the last 5 years. To sample a wide range of users&#8217; experiences, we selected those who reported that they <italic toggle="yes">liked very much</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">disliked very much</italic> their implant on a 4-point Likert scale (1=disliked very much, 2=disliked a little, 3=liked a little, and 4=liked very much). In all, 24 participants were selected for interviews on a <italic toggle="yes">first come first serve</italic> basis, 12 who <italic toggle="yes">liked very much</italic> and 12 who <italic toggle="yes">disliked very much</italic> their implants and could be reached using the telephone numbers they provided.</p><p>Telephone interviews were audio-recorded and guided by findings from the YouTube analysis and scientific literature review. Specifically, we focused on the in-depth phone interview (IDI) guide on themes from the scientific literature and those YouTube users referenced frequently (identified using SNOMED). We categorized these themes into 6 broad categories: (1) general questions about participants&#8217; experiences with subdermal implants, (2) decision making around the use of an implant, (3) acceptability of the implant, (4) the implantation process, (5) the removal process, and (6) recommendations for researchers working on a future PrEP implant. Participants were also asked about their reasons for removing the contraceptive implant. Upon completing the interviews, participants were compensated with US $50 Amazon gift cards.</p><p>Next, audio-recordings of the interviews were transcribed and cleaned for accuracy. To analyze the data, a codebook was developed jointly by the principal investigator of the project and a research assistant. It incorporated categories and themes from the interview guide and included definitions, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and examples of passages for inclusion. To validate and finalize the codebook, 2 researchers coded 2 transcripts independently, met to reconcile discrepant codes, and modified the codebook as needed to ensure that all themes of interest were being accurately captured. Researchers, then, proceeded to code the remainder of the transcripts in pairs, meeting after every 11 transcripts (half of the remaining data) were coded to reconcile discrepant codes. The finalized codes were analyzed using content analysis [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to identify prevalent themes, illustrative examples of each theme, and knowledge gaps.</p></sec><sec><title>Stage 4: Web-Based Surveys With Gay and Bisexual Men</title><p>Findings from the IDIs among cisgender women in stage 3 informed the development of a web-based quantitative assessment. This assessment took approximately 3 min to complete and aimed to determine how likely members of key HIV risk demographics (ie, GBM) would be to use an implant for HIV prevention. Specifically, we published text-based pop-up advertisements (known as broadcasts) on Grindr, a dating and <italic toggle="yes">hookup</italic> app for GBM. Logistically, these advertisements popped up the first time any Grindr user within a specified location opened the app; users who clicked on the advertisement were automatically rerouted to the quantitative assessment. For the purposes of this study, we published 2 broadcast advertisements (per city) in New York City, Baltimore, and Chicago. The quantitative assessment was open to anyone who wished to take it; eligible participants reported identifying as a gay man who was at least 18 years old. We focused our recruitment on GBM (rather than cisgender heterosexual cisgender women) because this population is at comparatively higher risk for HIV exposure and is one of the planned target populations for future PrEP implant studies. To reduce the odds of receiving multiple entries from the same person, participants did not receive compensation for their time, and surveys that had identical Internet Protocol addresses were eliminated. Additionally, for the purposes of the analyses presented in this paper, only HIV-negative GBM who lived in the United States were included.</p><p>As the PrEP implant is still hypothetical, we posed a variety of device configurations to participants. Specifically, the quantitative assessment measured how willing participants would be to use a hypothetical HIV prevention implant given a number of different factors: varying lengths of effectiveness (eg, 12 months, 6-8 months, and 2-3 months), number of implantable devices required, potential physical side effects (eg, bruising and scarring) resulting from the implantation or removal processes, implant size, and the convenience of using an implant compared with taking a daily HIV prevention pill (PrEP).

The value 3 on this scale represented a neutral response. Questions were presented in a different random order for each participant to minimize potential bias.

However, the scant body of existing evidence on implant facilitators shows that these include low implant cost, same-day insertion [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the inherent privacy of implants (eg, you can use this contraceptive method with low risk of others finding out) [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We were unable to identify scientific studies focused on user preferences regarding specific implant attributes (eg, size) or device-related effects (eg, bruising and local pain).

However, the existing literature did show that many of the problems associated with <italic toggle="yes">general</italic> contraceptive implant use are similar to those observed in relation to oral PrEP use. For example, several studies identified patient or provider misconceptions or lack of information about implants as a barrier to their uptake. Specifically, patients who have providers who harbor misconceptions about PrEP (eg, PrEP is only moderately effective) are less likely to obtain a prescription for this medication from their provider [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, concerns about contraceptive implants&#8217; side effect profiles and potential high cost deterred use; these same barriers also affected oral PrEP use [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Finally, access to contraceptive implants or oral PrEP was a challenge to use for each of these products [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. All these concerns are likely to translate to PrEP implants. Suggestions from the contraceptive and oral PrEP studies on how to overcome these issues may be helpful. For instance, concerted efforts (eg, trainings) to ensure that providers have accurate information about PrEP [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] implants (including information on insertion and removal techniques) and effective tools to identify PrEP implant candidates could be helpful. Same-day access to PrEP implant insertion could also boost uptake [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; offering PrEP implants in emergency department settings could also boost implant uptake.</p><p>Potential device side effects were a concern, as expressed by participants in stages 2, 3, and 4. Specifically, in stage 2, YouTube videos identified a number of potential side effects related to contraceptive implant use that could potentially be concerns for PrEP implant users, including pain, stinging, burning, soreness or tenderness, contusion, scarring, and bleeding. Participants in stage 3 also reported these effects after contraceptive implants were inserted or removed, although this was typically mild. Results from stage 4 showed that the possibility of experiencing these effects (eg, moderate bruising, small scar, some pain, bleeding, and tenderness) did not impact GBM participants&#8217; likelihood of using PrEP implants. Although these outcomes may not present a barrier to use for these men, this is not the case for all potential users. For example, other studies have shown that some transgender women were concerned that mild scarring and other skin-related reactions related to potential future PrEP implants could become serious [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, it may be necessary to engage novel strategies to communicate actual risk [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], as some populations may overestimate this. Icon arrays, which communicate risk using graphical representations of icons symbolizing people affected by a given outcome (eg, circles), may be one such strategy [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Icon arrays are shown to be better at communicating risk for low-risk procedures and may be especially effective for populations that have variability in numeracy skills [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Stage 2 YouTube videos reported menstrual complaints related to contraceptive implants. Stage 3 interviews also revealed that contraceptive implants had a negative effect on menstruation for some users. Specifically, over half of the participants endorsed this idea, complaining of prolonged or unpredictable cycles. It is highly unlikely that the menstrual or hormonal issues identified in stages 2 and 3 would be problematic for PrEP implant users, as these effects are associated with the use of hormonal medications, not antiretrovirals. However, given that this is such a pervasive issue among contraceptive implant users, it is paramount to ensure that potential PrEP implant users do not attribute these effects to implants in general. Rather, we must clarify that implants are a method to distribute a variety of medications. They are not a medication themselves. Potential PrEP implant users must be made aware that hormonal medications used in contraceptive implants, and antiretroviral medications used in PrEP implants will have completely different effects from one another. Communicating this will be particularly important for cisgender and transgender women users, as they may have greater familiarity with contraceptive implants and may be more concerned about how PrEP implants would interact with female hormones. Stage 4 participants were not asked about this theme because (1) this concern would not apply to male users and (2) medications contained in PrEP implants are not anticipated to interfere with male hormones.</p><p>Although negative side effects can deter implant use, other side effects may be seen as positive. Nearly half of the participants in stage 3 revealed that they chose the contraceptive implant because they believed that it had a more favorable side effect profile than other available options. Although specific side effects of the antiretroviral drug that would be delivered via implant are still under study (eg, these side effects may be different, and data show that these drugs are well tolerated [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]), it is critical to consider their side effects parallel to the HIV prevention effects of these medications. Users&#8217; experiences with oral PrEP show that this is the case; fear or experience with unfavorable short- (eg, gastrointestinal effects) or long-term side effects (eg, renal toxicity) are factors for drug discontinuation in 9.2%-33.0% of GBM who stop taking PrEP [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>-<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. implants that distribute PrEP medications that have side effect profiles perceived as too intolerable may have limited uptake and continued use.</p><p>Conversely, if they seem to have fewer or beneficial side effects due to the delivery method, this could be viewed as positive. For instance, some stage 3 participants reported using contraceptive implants because they have the potential to have the beneficial side effect of lessened menstruation. Although it is highly unlikely that PrEP implants would have a similar effect, it is important to note the appeal of beneficial side effects. This is particularly important for those beneficial side effects that produce a notable enhancement in the life or appearance of the user, since these enhancements could potentially facilitate improved uptake or sustained use. Beneficial side effects have been noted in other medications, including finasteride (hair regrowth in men experiencing male pattern baldness [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and initially used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]) or oral contraceptives (facial acne reduction and initially used to prevent pregnancy [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). If and when beneficial side effects are identified in drugs contained in PrEP implants, this could play a role in future messaging and uptake campaigns.</p><p>The effectiveness and duration of products as well as the amount of maintenance they would require were important to participants in stages 2-4. Specifically, participants in stage 3 liked that the contraceptive implant was effective at preventing pregnancy and lasted for a prolonged period, during which little maintenance was required on their behalf (eg, they did not have to perform a routine activity, such as taking a daily pill). Participants in stage 4 shared this sentiment, and not having to take a daily pill increased the likelihood of using the PrEP implant. Additionally, in stage 4, protection against HIV lasting 6 months or more modestly increased potential users&#8217; likelihood of implant use; protection lasting 2-3 months modestly decreased the likelihood of use. Given this, it is critical in development phases to prioritize the amount of time that the implant will last and the amount of maintenance it requires.</p><p>The size and number of devices were also important. For example, in stage 3, participants found the small size and unintrusiveness (eg, most participants could not feel the implant during daily activities) of the contraceptive implant to be positive attributes. In stage 4, participants found the potential implant size (slightly longer and fatter than a matchstick) neither motivated nor dissuaded the likelihood of use. This may mean that the current size is acceptable. However, reducing the size of the implant could have a positive impact on potential users&#8217; perceptions of it. Related to this, stage 4 participants also reported that as the number of implants necessary to provide protection against HIV increases, the likelihood of use of this prevention strategy decreases. Taken together, this means that implant size and the number of implants necessary to achieve HIV protection are also critical factors for potential user uptake. The trajectory of contraceptive implant development shows that although it may not be possible to devise a small, 1-device implant in the first product iteration, it is possible to reduce implant size and number over time [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, developers of PrEP implants should aim to reduce the size and number of devices, even if this is not immediately possible.</p><p>Participants in stage 3 (all cisgender women) reported that the insertion and removal procedures for contraceptive implants were quick and straightforward, with minimal pain. There was no mention of discomfort related to having this procedure done in a health care provider&#8217;s office. However, a minority of participants reported feeling intimidated by the size of the trocar used to insert the contraceptive implant. This was not the case in stage 4. Stage 4 participants (all GBM) did not find the potential trocar planned for use in clinical research to implant the PrEP implant to be a barrier to uptake. It is important to note that no participants in stage 4 had ever undergone this procedure, although stage 3 participants had. This could have contributed to differences in participants&#8217; level of comfort with trocar insertion.</p><p>Furthermore, having the implant t removed by a health care provider appeared to mildly improve the likelihood of use among stage 4 participants. Thus, it appears that users of contraceptive implants and potential users of PrEP implants are mostly comfortable with the proposed model for device application and removal. However, although we can only speculate, it may be that this level of comfort is based on the proposed length of time that the implant could be used. That is, potential users may be less likely to undergo these insertion and removal processes if the implant does not last for very long. This again highlights the importance of the device duration.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>In stage 2, we may have missed some references to specific participant experiences if participants used descriptive words not contained in SNOMED&#8217;s database. The interviews we conducted as part of stage 3 were partially meant to address this potential gap by more fully fleshing out users&#8217; experiences with contraceptive implants. As is the case with all research on acceptability and feasibility of hypothetical clinical products, it is difficult to estimate the gap between participants&#8217; perceived likelihood of use and actual use of implants for PrEP. However, data from past and current users of similar implants for contraception in stages 2 and 3 help to mediate this issue.</p><p>Additionally, because we were concerned with ensuring that users&#8217; experiences with existing implants were as similar as possible to potential future PrEP implants, we sampled only women in stage 3. In stage 4, we targeted only GBM (as they have a higher risk for HIV exposure compared with heterosexual cisgender women) with web-based surveys on their preferences for PrEP implants. Given the lack of formative work specific to GBM, there may be a gap in the preferences and perceptions of this implant product between these 2 groups. Future studies should conduct qualitative interviews with GBM on their preferences around PrEP implant products to limit this shortcoming. Despite these limitations, given the dearth of research on this topic, this work makes an important and unique contribution to the literature on implants for PrEP.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In all stages of research, participants reported experiencing (stages 2 and 3) or anticipating (stage 4) implant-related side effects. These effects were related to the device itself (bleeding, bruising, and pain after insertion) or, among contraceptive implant users, medication-related side effects (menstrual changes, weight gain, and acne). Although it is highly unlikely that PrEP implant users will experience similar hormonal side effects to contraceptive implant users, it is critical to point out the difference between these 2 products to potential PrEP users. Icon arrays could be a useful way to communicate serious risks related to implant devices. Future studies should monitor for the presence of beneficial side effects related to implant medication, as this has been evidenced with other medications and may improve uptake and sustained use. Furthermore, small implants need only 1 device, last for at least six months, are unintrusive, and require little to no user effort to optimize uptake. Current and potential future users appear comfortable with the currently used procedures for implant insertion and removal. Finally, future work should include more formative work specific to GBM, as this will allow researchers to address their concerns with greater precision.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
